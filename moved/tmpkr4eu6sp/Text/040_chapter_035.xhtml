<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Itâ€™s easier to iron a damp shirt but a good steam iron will make short work of a bone-dry one, too. The rest is down to technique. Remember to iron around buttons rather than over them as you work through these stages. Follow this order to avoid creasing areas already ironed.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-num"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>1</strong></span> Start by ironing the back of the collar. Flip the shirt over and iron the collar front.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-num"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>2</strong></span> Next iron both cuffs, inside first and then outside.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-num"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>3</strong></span> Iron the shoulders next and then the yoke between them. Fit the end of each shoulder in turn around the nose of the ironing board to make this easy (see image below).</span></p>&#13;

<p class="noindent-num"><a id="page_47"/><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>4</strong></span> Iron the back of the sleeves. Lay one sleeve at a time on the board, shape to straighten the seam and match any crease on top of the sleeve from previous ironing. Start ironing from the top of a sleeve, working your way down to the cuff. Turn the shirt over and iron the front of the sleeve in the same way.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-num"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>5</strong></span> Then iron the front and back of the shirt. Start with the right-hand front and feed the shirt over the board as you go, so you iron the back and finally the left-hand front. Wiggle around the front buttons with the tip of the iron (see image below).</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-num"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>6</strong></span> If the back has a box pleat (a pleat which runs down the middle of the shirt), start ironing at the top of it while pulling on the bottom with your free hand to define the shape easily.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-num"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>7</strong></span> Finish by ironing the collar in half lengthways, as it would be when you wear it. Put the shirt on a hanger and button from the collar downwards.</span></p>&#13;

<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Beeswax polish protects unvarnished wood furniture and internal doors from splits and cracks, often caused by exposure to central heating. Proper application also helps build up protection against spills and stains and gives a pleasing mellow shine that can last for months.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Natural creamed beeswax polish is easier to apply than solid wax polish. Use a soft, clean cloth to apply it, rubbing with the grain of the wood as you work it over small areas at a time. Shine by rubbing with a separate clean cloth.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Resist buying spray polishes: these are silicone-based to give shine but they don’t nourish the wood and can even cause it to dry out. Once silicone has been applied it is practically impossible to remove it without stripping off the whole surface of the wood and it can produce a milky look as it builds—rather like bloom on old chocolate.</span></p>&#13;

<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Check that you have a properly inflated spare tire, a jack and the vehicle’s tool kit. These are usually stored under the floor of the boot and in adjacent compartments.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">If you are on a gradient, check that the handbrake is on and wedge the unaffected tires from the front or behind as appropriate.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Remove the wheel’s hubcap according to your car manual’s directions. Loosen the wheel nuts with the wheel wrench but don’t remove them completely. (If you have locking wheel nuts, use the key provided in the locking wheel kit to slacken the nuts.)</span></p>&#13;

<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Next, fit the jack as directed in the car’s manual. It’s important to do this correctly so that you don’t buckle the bodywork.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Wind the handle until the wheel is raised a couple inches off the ground. Remove the loosened wheel nuts, then pull the tire off the car.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Put on the new tire, tighten the wheel nuts and lower the jack. Check that the wheel nuts are fully tightened and the hubcap replaced before driving away. Remember: the spare tire is designed for emergencies and short-term use afterwards. Stow the damaged tire and tools in the trunk until you can take it in for repair or buy a new one.</span></p>&#13;

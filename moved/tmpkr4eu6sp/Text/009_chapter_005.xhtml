<p class="noindenta"><strong><span class="cl_4A4B62">You’ll need a chopping board and a sharp knife.</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-num"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>1</strong></span> Place the onion on the board. Hold it steady and chop off both ends of the onion, about 0.5 inches in.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-num"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>2</strong></span> Peel off the brown, papery skin. If the first outer layer of white flesh is dry and tough, peel this off too.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-num"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>3</strong></span> Turn the onion onto one of its cut ends and cut it in half. Place each half face down on the board. It’s the fumes from the exposed cut face of the onion that cause our eyes to water, so keeping the cut side facing the board will reduce onion tears.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-num"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>4</strong></span> Take half at a time and hold the edges of the onion firmly. Cut it into slices from right to left.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-num"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>5</strong></span> Then turn the onion 90 degrees on the board and cut in the same motion again from right to left, giving you neat, regular pieces of onion. The onion can become slippery, so cut any stray lengths individually for an even dice.</span></p>&#13;

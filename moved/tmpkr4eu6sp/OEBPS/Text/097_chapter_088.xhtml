<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Station yourself in the seat closest to the middle, facing towards the stern. Hold the paddle with one hand on the top and the other gripping just above the blade. The top of the paddle should remain at eye level. Here are the basic strokes you need to know.</span></p>
<p class="Ssubhead"><span class="cl_F26760"><strong>FORWARD</strong></span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">On the side of the canoe nearest your lower hand, reach the paddle blade forward and into the water until your arm is fully extended. Pull the submerged paddle blade through the water until it is behind you. Rotate your shoulder forward and back with the direction of the stroke (rather than your spine). Pull the blade out of the water and repeat. Keep the paddle as vertical as possible by ensuring that your top hand is out over the water.</span></p>

<p class="Ssubhead"><span class="cl_F26760"><strong>BACK</strong></span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">This is the reverse of the forward stroke. Put your blade in the water behind you and pull it through the water to the front of you.</span></p>
<p class="Ssubhead"><a id="page_111"/><span class="cl_F26760"><strong>COURSE CORRECTION AND TURNING</strong></span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Paddling on one side continuously will turn the canoe round in a circle. For a quicker, more controlled turn, use a series of “J” strokes. This a useful stroke for correcting your course every few strokes, instead of having to change the paddle over from side to side. At the end of a forward stroke, as your arms come backwards, rotate your top hand inward towards the boat and down, and your lower arm slightly outwards to make a “J” in the water.</span></p>

<p class="Ssubhead"><span class="cl_F26760"><strong>PRY</strong></span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">To move the canoe sideways away from an object, angle the paddle under the side of the canoe nearest to the object you want to move away from. Your top hand should be furthest away from you. Then pull the handle towards the boat until the paddle is vertical in the water.</span></p>

<p class="Ssubhead"><span class="cl_F26760"><strong>DRAW</strong></span></p>
<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">To move the canoe sideways towards an object, reach the paddle out and away from where you are sitting and into the water. Pull the paddle through the water towards you until it is vertical.</span></p>

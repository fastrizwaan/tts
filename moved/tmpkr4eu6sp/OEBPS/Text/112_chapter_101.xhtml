<p class="subhead-t"><span class="bg_tip"><strong>TOP TIPS</strong></span></p>
<p class="noindent-bull"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="bull">•</span> Keep the body of your letter as short as possible and to the point. Check that you have stated what action, if any, is required by the recipient.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-bull"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="bull">•</span> Put “Dear Sir/Dear Madam” as the salutation if you don’t know the name of the recipient and match it with “Yours faithfully” as your sign off. Keep “Yours sincerely” for when you do know the name of the addressee.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-bull"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="bull">•</span> Read your letter over again before you send it to review it for clarity, as well as grammar and spelling errors. Be sure that you’ve covered all the information pertinent to the recipient and keep a copy for yourself.</span></p>

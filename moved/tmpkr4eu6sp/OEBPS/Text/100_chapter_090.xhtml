<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Encourage the person to cough up the obstruction in the first instance.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">The next step is to slap them on the back between the shoulder blades five times with the heel of your palm, while you help them to lean forward.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">If the victim can’t speak, cry, cough or breathe, it’s serious. Without first-aid assistance they will become unconscious.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">The next remedy to try is known as the Heimlich maneuver. Stand <a id="page_115"/>behind the person and slightly to one side. Put your arms around them so your hands meet in the area between the bottom of their ribcage and their belly button. Form your lower hand into a fist. Pull sharply upwards and inwards up to five times.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Should this not clear the blockage, call 911 for help.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">While you are waiting for help to arrive continue to alternate the series of five back blows with the abdominal thrusts. If the patient become unresponsive, start cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with chest compressions—see page 117 for details of how to do this.</span></p>
<p class="subhead1"><strong><span class="cl_F26760">IMPORTANT:</span></strong></p>
<p class="indent-bull"><span class="cl_F26760"><span class="bull">•</span> Don’t give abdominal thrusts to babies under one year old or to pregnant women.</span></p>
<p class="indent-bull"><span class="cl_F26760"><span class="bull">•</span> If you’re alone and choking severely, dial 911 immediately and perform abdominal thrusts on yourself to try to dislodge the item.</span></p>

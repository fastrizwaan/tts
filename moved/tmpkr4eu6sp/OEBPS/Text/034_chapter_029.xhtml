<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">A stitch in time saves nine; catch a small hole in your favorite cashmere sweater or pair of woolen socks and the mend might be invisible.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">With a tiny hole in a fine knit sweater, you may be able to get away with using cotton or embroidery thread. Knitted wool is forgiving and if you sew carefully, the darn will blend in with its surroundings. Otherwise, you’ll need a darning needle and woolen thread that’s the same ply and color as your garment and a darning mushroom (or equivalent).</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Place a wooden darning mushroom beneath large holes to support the fabric. These can be purchased online or in sewing shops. Alternatively, you could use an orange or a lemon.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Thread your needle and stitch vertical support threads across the hole. Start the vertical supports well away from the hole to reinforce thin, worn wool close to the edges.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Follow the lines of the knit, or the “v”s of stocking stitch, and incorporate any worn, ragged edges as you darn. Then weave in and out through those supports horizontally, always taking care not to pucker the stitches by pulling them tight. The horizontal rows of stitching can start nearer the hole. Use the needle to pick up alternate vertical strands to the previous row. When complete, remove the darning mushroom and fasten off on the reverse side.</span></p>

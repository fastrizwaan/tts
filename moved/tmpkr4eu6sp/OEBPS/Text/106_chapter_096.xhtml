<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">The most common places for blisters to occur is on the feet and hands. Wearing new shoes or taking part in activities such as running or dancing can cause friction and pressure on the feet; gripping sports equipment like tennis rackets and golf clubs can blister palms and fingers.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">The fluid that fills a blister is the body’s way of protecting the tissue underneath from further damage. A burst blister, which can easily happen from further pressure to fragile skin, is painful and prone to infection if not treated.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">As a precautionary measure, carry sticking band-aids or blister band-aids with you to protect, cushion and keep blisters clean. When you need to use a regular band-aid, don’t apply it too tightly. Keep a bit of space in the middle to allow some air around the blister. Apply to clean, dry skin and change daily. Leave blister band-aids on until they fall off.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">If possible, it’s advisable to let your blisters heal without popping them.</span></p>

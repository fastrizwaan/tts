<p class="image-c"><img alt="image" src="../Images/f0104-01.jpg" width="50%"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Place the compass on the map. With one of the straight outer edges of the compass, line up point A (where you are) with point B (where you want to go), being sure that the “direction of travel” arrow is pointing towards B.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Keeping the compass firmly in this position, turn the compass housing ring so that “north” and the red hatched orienteering arrow both point to the top of the map—making sure that there is no metal around you that will interfere with your compass arrow’s magnetism. (Don’t worry about what the floating compass needle is doing when you do this.)</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">When you are convinced that the compass housing is correctly aligned to the north, remove the compass from the map. Holding <a id="page_105"/>the compass flat in your hand, turn yourself around until the red compass needle aligns itself parallel to the lines inside the compass housing area. Be sure the needle is pointing to north, not south, to avoid setting off in the opposite direction.</span></p>
<p class="image-c" id="fig15"><img alt="image" src="../Images/f0105-01.jpg" width="70%"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Walk in the direction of travel, holding the compass with the red compass needle matching the red hatched orienteering needle as closely as possible. To get your bearings, fix your sight on an immovable, distant feature in the landscape that’s in line with your direction and walk towards it. Once there, check you are still on course, pick another landmark and walk towards that. Repeat this until you reach your destination: point B!</span></p>

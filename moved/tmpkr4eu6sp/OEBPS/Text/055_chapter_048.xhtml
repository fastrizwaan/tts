<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_F26760"><strong>DIY SAFETY WARNING:</strong> Before taking any sort of tool to a wall, or making a hole in it, check what’s behind the surface by scanning the area with a multi-purpose digital detector: this will indicate if there are any pipes, cables or studs where you’re about to work. Either try to borrow one, as they are expensive to buy, or download an app to your phone.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">A common mistake is to hang artwork too high. The center of the picture, or group of pictures, should be at eye level when you stand and look at it—but of course this depends how tall you are! Art galleries measure 57 inches from the floor as standard.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-num"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>1</strong></span> Consider where you want your picture, gauging its relationship to doors and furniture and the length of the wall space. Have someone else hold the picture in place while you stand back and check the position. Use a tape measure to be accurate in positioning its distance from other adjacent artwork and objects.</span></p>

<p class="noindent-num"><a id="page_63"/><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>2</strong></span> Also test that the picture hook will be concealed by the picture by suspending the hanging wire on the hook and letting it take the weight (see image on adjacent page). Mark your chosen position in pencil on the wall. Thread the nail through the eyelet of the hook and hammer it into the wall at a 45 degree angle.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-num"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>3</strong></span> A single hook is fine for small, lightweight pictures. For a bigger picture choose a double picture hook. For a heavy one, you will need a screw and a standard drywall anchor to secure the screw (see image below). You’ll also need a power drill to make any impression on a masonry wall. Drill a hole big enough to take the anchor. Fit the anchor into the hole, making sure it is tightly embedded and flush with the wall. Choose the type of screw that has a head to hang the picture on and insert it.</span></p>

<div class="fmhT"><b>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b></div>&#13;
<div class="fmtx">I extend my appreciation and thanks to my team at SUCCESS Media and <i>SUCCESS</i> magazine, who have supported me through this labor of blood, sweat, and almost tears, particularly my good friends and colleagues Reed Bilbray and Stuart Johnson…</div>&#13;
<div class="fmtx">To my writing muse and collaborator, Linda Sivertsen, who helped pull out the stories and references from my past and give my process order and coherence…</div>&#13;
<div class="fmtx">To the editing wizardry of Erin Casey, the always-genius touch of our <i>SUCCESS</i> magazine editor Lisa Ocker, and to our editor in chief, Deborah Heisz…</div>&#13;
<div class="fmtx">To the many brilliant personal-development experts I have worked with and learned from over the past two decades—all the CEOs, revolutionary entrepreneurs, and extraordinary achievers I have had the chance to interview and glean new insights, ideas, and wisdom from…</div>&#13;
<div class="fmtx">To all the readers of <i>SUCCESS</i> magazine, my blog, and my other works, and whose enthusiastic and appreciative feedback inspires me to want to continue to pursue the zenith of my potential, so I can better assist others to find theirs…</div>&#13;
<div class="fmtx">And finally, and most important, to my beautiful and wonderful wife, Georgia, who sacrificed many late nights and weekends without me while I worked to complete this manuscript.</div>&#13;

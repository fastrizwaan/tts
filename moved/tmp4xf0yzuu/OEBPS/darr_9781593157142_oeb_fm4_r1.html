<div class="fmhT"><b>SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM ANTHONY ROBBINS</b></div>
<div class="fmtx">During the past three decades, I’ve had the privilege of helping more than 4 million people create breakthroughs in their lives. I’ve worked with an immensely diverse group of people—from presidents of countries to prisoners, Olympic athletes, and Oscar-winning entertainers, from billionaire entrepreneurs to those just struggling to start their own business. Whether working with a couple fighting to keep their family together or a person in prison searching for a way to change their life from the inside out, my focus has always been on helping people achieve real and <i>sustainable</i> results. You can’t do that through a magic pill or secret formula, but <i>only</i> through understanding the real tools, strategies, and science behind what it takes to break through the patterns that defeat so many and achieve a meaningful life.</div>
<div class="fmtx">Darren and I both made the decision to take control of our lives at an early age. We searched for answers by seeking out people who were living the kind of life we wanted to live. Then we applied what we learned. It’s not really all that <?dp n="16" folio="" ?> surprising that we both cite Jim Rohn as a mentor. Jim was a master at helping people understand the truths, the laws, and the practices that lead to real, lasting success. Jim taught us that achievement is not about luck; it’s really a science. Sure, everyone is different, but the same laws of success always apply. You reap what you sow; you can’t get out of life what you’re not willing to put into it. If you want more love, give more love. If you want greater success, help others achieve more. And when you study and master the science of achievement, you will find the success you desire.</div>
<div class="fmtx">Darren Hardy is living proof of this philosophy. He walks the talk. What he shares in his book is based on what has worked in his life—and mine as well.</div>
<div class="fmtx">This is a guy who has taken simple but profound fundamentals of what it takes to be successful and used them to earn more than a million dollars a year by age twenty-four, and build a company to more than $50 million by age twenty-seven. For the past twenty years, his life has been a personal laboratory of study and research on the topic of success. He’s used himself as a guinea pig, testing thousands of different ideas, resources, and tools, and through his failings and his triumphs, he’s figured out which ideas and strategies have merit, and which ones are just plain BS.</div>
<div class="fmtx">For sixteen years, I have crossed paths with Darren, who as a leader in the personal-development industry, has worked closely with hundreds of top writers, speakers, and thought leaders. He has trained tens of thousands of entrepreneurs, advised many large companies, and personally mentored dozens of top CEOs and high-performance achievers, extracting from them what really matters and really works, <?dp n="17" folio="" ?> and what doesn’t. In his role as publisher of <i>SUCCESS</i> magazine, Darren sits at the center of the personal development industry. He’s interviewed top leaders, from Richard Branson to General Colin Powell to Lance Armstrong, on a multitude of success topics, and drilled down to their best ideas, compiling them all—even a few of mine. He is an all-consuming, sorting, filtering, digesting, analyzing, summarizing, categorizing, itemizing, personal-achievement encyclopedia of information. He has culled the clutter, and focused on the core fundamentals that matter—fundamentals that you can immediately implement in <i>your</i> life to produce measurable and sustainable results.</div>
<div class="fmtx"><i>The Compound Effect</i> is the operator’s manual that teaches you how to own the system, how to control it, master it, and shape it to your needs and desires. Once you do, there is nothing you can’t obtain or achieve.</div>
<div class="fmtx"><i>The Compound Effect</i> is based on a principle I’ve used in my own life and training; that is, your decisions shape your destiny. The future is what you make of it. Little, everyday decisions will either take you to the life you desire or to disaster by default. In fact, it’s the littlest decisions that shape our lives. Stray off course by just two millimeters, and your trajectory changes; what seemed like a tiny, inconsequential decision then can become a mammoth miscalculation now. From what to eat and where to work, to the people you spend your time with, to how you spend your afternoon, every choice shapes how you live today, but more important, how you live the rest of your life. But the good news is, change is within you. In the same way a two-millimeter miscalculation can send you veering wildly off your life’s course, a mere two-millimeter readjustment can also <?dp n="18" folio="" ?> bring you right back home. The trick is finding the plan, the guide, the map that shows you where that home is. How you get there. How you stay on the path.</div>
<div class="fmtx">This book <i>is</i> that detailed, tangible plan of action. Let it shake up your expectations, eliminate your assumptions, ignite your curiosity, and bring value to your life—starting right <i>now</i>. Take advantage of this tool. Use it as a guide to create the life and the success you want. If you do this, and if you do all the other right things—and keep doing them day in and day out—I know you will experience the best life has to offer.</div>

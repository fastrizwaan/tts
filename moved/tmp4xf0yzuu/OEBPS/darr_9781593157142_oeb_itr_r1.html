<div class="fmhT"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></div>
<div class="fmtx">This book is about success and what it really takes to earn it. It’s time someone told it to you straight. You’ve been bamboozled for too long. There is no magic bullet, secret formula, or quick fix. You don’t make $200,000 a year spending two hours a day on the Internet, lose 30 pounds in a week, rub 20 years off your face with a cream, fix your love life with a pill, or find lasting success with any other scheme that is too good to be true. It would be great if you could buy your success, fame, self-esteem, good relationships, and health and well-being in a nicely clam-shelled package at the local Walmart. But, that’s not how it works.</div>
<div class="fmtx">We are constantly bombarded with increasingly sensational claims to get rich, get fit, get younger, get sexier… all overnight with little effort for only three easy payments of $39.95. These repetitive marketing messages have distorted our sense of what it really takes to succeed. We’ve lost sight of the simple but profound fundamentals of what it takes to be successful.</div>
<div class="fmtx">I’m tired of it. I won’t sit back and watch these reckless messages derail people any longer. I wrote this book to take you back to basics. I’m going to help you clear the clutter and bring focus to the <?dp n="20" folio="2" ?> core fundamentals that matter. You can immediately implement in <i>your</i> life the exercises and time-tested success principles this book contains to produce measurable and sustainable results. I’m going to teach you to harness the power of the Compound Effect, the operating system that has been running your life, for better or worse. Use this system to your advantage and you truly can revolutionize your life. You have heard you can achieve anything you set your mind to, right? Well, only if you know how. <i>The Compound Effect</i> is the operator’s manual that teaches you how to master the system. When you do, there is nothing you can’t obtain or achieve.</div>
<div class="fmtx">How do I know that the Compound Effect is the only process you need for ultimate success? Firstly, I have applied these principles to my own life. Now I hate it when authors beat their chests about their fame and fortune, but it’s important you know I speak from personal experience—I’m offering you living proof, not regurgitated theory. As Anthony Robbins mentioned, I’ve enjoyed significant success in my business endeavors because I’ve made it a point to live by the principles you’ll read in this book. For the past twenty years I’ve been intensely studying success and human achievement. I have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars testing thousands of different ideas, resources, and philosophies. My personal experience has proven that, no matter what you learn or what strategy or tactic you employ, success comes as the result of the operating system of the Compound Effect.</div>
<div class="fmtx">Secondly, for the past sixteen years I have been a leader in the personal-development industry. I’ve worked with respected thought leaders, speakers and authors. As a speaker and consultant, I’ve trained tens of thousands of entrepreneurs. I’ve <?dp n="21" folio="3" ?> mentored business leaders, corporate executives and countless high-achievers. From thousands of case studies I have extracted what works—and what doesn’t.</div>
<div class="fmtx">Thirdly, as publisher of <i>SUCCESS</i> magazine, I sift through thousands of article submissions and books, help choose the experts we feature in the magazine, and review all of their material. Each month I interview a half-dozen top experts on a multitude of success topics and drill down to their best ideas. All day, every day, I read and filter through an ocean of personal-achievement information.</div>
<div class="fmtx">Here’s my point. When you have such an exhaustive view of this industry, and wisdom gained through studying the teachings and best practices of some the world’s most successful people, an amazing clarity emerges—the underlying fundamental truths become crystal clear. Having seen it, read it, and heard most all of it, I can no longer be fooled by the latest gambit or self-proclaimed prophet with the newest “scientific breakthrough.” Nobody can sell me on gimmicks. I have too many reference points. I’ve gone down too many roads and learned the truth the hard way. As my mentor, the great business philosopher Jim Rohn, said, “There are no new fundamentals. Truth is not new; it’s old. You’ve got to be a little suspicious of the guy who says, ‘Come over here, I want to show you my manufactured antiques!’ No, you can’t manufacture antiques.”</div>
<div class="fmtx">What this book is about, with all the unnecessary noise, fat, and fluff removed, is what really matters. What really works? What half-dozen basics, when focused on and mastered, constitute the operating system that can take you to any goal you desire and help you live the life you were meant to live? This book contains <?dp n="22" folio="4" ?> those half-dozen fundamentals; they comprise the operating system called <i>the Compound Effect</i>.</div>
<div class="fmtx">Before we dig in, I have one warning: Earning success is hard. The process is laborious, tedious, sometimes even boring. Becoming wealthy, influential, and world-class in your field is slow and arduous. Don’t get me wrong; you’ll see results in your life from following these steps almost immediately. But if you have an aversion to work, discipline, and commitment, you’re welcome to turn the TV back on and put your hope in the next infomercial—the one touting promises of overnight success, if you have access to a major credit card.</div>
<div class="fmtx">Here’s the bottom line: You already know all that you need to succeed. You don’t need to learn anything more. If all we needed was more information, everyone with an Internet connection would live in a mansion, have abs of steel, and be blissfully happy. New or more information is <i>not</i> what you need—a new plan of <i>action</i> is. It’s time to create new behaviors and habits that are oriented away from sabotage and toward success. It’s that simple.</div>
<div class="fmtx">Throughout the book I mention resources I’ve made available at <a href="http://TheCompoundEffect.com">TheCompoundEffect.com</a>. Please, go there! Use them! This book and the tools I’ve provided to support you offer the best of everything I’ve heard, seen, studied, and tried. It’s the best of what we bring you every month in <i>SUCCESS</i> magazine, all in one life-changing little book. And it <i>is</i> simple!</div>
<div class="fmtx">Let’s get started!</div>

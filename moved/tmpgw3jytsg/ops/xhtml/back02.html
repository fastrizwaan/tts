<h2 class="h2a"><a id="about"></a><a id="page_129"></a><strong>About Berrett-Koehler Publishers</strong></h2>
<p class="blockquote3">Berrett-Koehler is an independent publisher dedicated to an ambitious mission: Creating a World That Works for All.</p>
<p class="indent">We believe that to truly create a better world, action is needed at all levels&#8212;individual, organizational, and societal. At the individual level, our publications help people align their lives with their values and with their aspirations for a better world. At the organizational level, our publications promote progressive leadership and management practices, socially responsible approaches to business, and humane and effective organizations. At the societal level, our publications advance social and economic justice, shared prosperity, sustainability, and new solutions to national and global issues.</p>
<p class="indent">A major theme of our publications is &#8220;Opening Up New Space.&#8221; They challenge conventional thinking, introduce new ideas, and foster positive change. Their common quest is changing the underlying beliefs, mindsets, and structures that keep generating the same cycles of problems, no matter who our leaders are or what improvement programs we adopt.</p>
<p class="indent">We strive to practice what we preach&#8212;to operate our publishing company in line with the ideas in our books. At the core of our approach is stewardship, which we define as a deep sense of responsibility to administer the company for the benefit of all of our &#8220;stakeholder&#8221; groups: authors, customers, employees, investors, service providers, and the communities and environment around us. </p>
<p class="indent">We are grateful to the thousands of readers, authors, and other friends of the company who consider themselves to be part of the &#8220;BK Community.&#8221; We hope that you, too, will join us in our mission.</p>

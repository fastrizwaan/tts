<p class="blockquote1">Do your work; not just your work and no more, but a little more for the lavishing’s sake—that little more which is worth all the rest.<br/><small>DEAN BRIGGS</small></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You are remarkable! You have special talents and abilities that make you different from every other person who has ever lived. There are frogs you can eat, or learn to eat, that can make you one of the most important people in your business or organization.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There are certain things that you can do, or learn to do, that can make you extraordinarily valuable to yourself and to others. Your job is to identify your special areas of uniqueness and then to commit yourself to becoming very, very good in those areas.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3">Increase Your Earning Ability</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Your most valuable asset in terms of cash flow is your earning ability. Your ability to work enables you to bring tens of thousands of dollars into your life every year by simply applying your knowledge and skills to your <a id="page_68"/>world. This is your ability to eat specific frogs faster and better than others.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You could lose everything you own—your house, your car, your job, your bank account—but as long as you still had your earning ability, you could make it all back and more besides.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Take stock of your unique talents and abilities on a regular basis. What is it that you do especially well? What are you good at? What do you do easily and well that is difficult for other people? Looking back at your career, what has been most responsible for your success in life and work to date? What have been the most significant frogs you have eaten in the past?</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3">Do What You Love to Do</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You are designed such that you will most enjoy doing the very things that you can be the very best at. What is it that you enjoy the most about your work? What kind of frogs do you most enjoy eating? The very fact that you enjoy something means that you probably have within yourself the capability to be excellent in that area.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">One of your great responsibilities in life is for you to decide for yourself what you really love to do and then to throw your whole heart into doing that special thing very, very well.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Look at your various tasks and responsibilities. What is it that you do that gets you the most compliments and praise from other people? What do you do that positively affects the work and performance of other people more than anything else?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a id="page_69"/>Successful people are invariably those who have taken the time to identify what they do well and most enjoy. They know what they do that really makes a difference in their work, and they then concentrate on that task or area of activity exclusively.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You should always focus your best energies and abilities on starting and completing those key tasks that your unique talents and abilities enable you to do well and that make a significant contribution. You cannot do everything, but you can do those few things in which you excel, the few things that can really make a difference.</p>&#13;

<p class="sbt">EAT THAT FROG!</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><strong>1.</strong> Continually ask yourself these key questions:“What am I really good at? What do I enjoy the most about my work? What has been most responsible for my success in the past? If I could do any job at all, what job would it be?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you won the lottery or came into an enormous amount of money and you could choose any job or any part of a job to do for the indefinite future, what work would you choose?</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>2.</strong> Develop a personal plan to prepare yourself to do your most important tasks in an excellent fashion. Focus on those areas where you have special talents and that you most enjoy. This is the key to unlocking your personal potential.</p>&#13;

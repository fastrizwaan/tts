  <p class="noindent"><span class="dcap">B</span>read has been a dining staple for thousands of years. The art of breadmaking has evolved over time, but the basic principles remain unchanged. Bread is made from flour of wheat or other grains, with the addition of water, salt, and a fermenting ingredient (such as yeast or another leavening agent). After you’ve baked a few loaves, you’ll start to get a feel for what the dough should look and feel like. Then you can start experimenting with different flours, or additions of fruits, nuts, seeds, herbs, and more.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Quick Breads</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Muffins, banana bread, zucchini bread, and many other sweet breads are often leavened with agents other than yeast, such as baking soda or baking powder. These breads are easy to make and require far less preparation time than yeast breads. They’re also very versatile; once you master the basic recipe you can add almost any fruit, nut, or flavoring to make a uniquely delicious treat.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Basic Quick Bread Recipe</span></p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Yeast Bread</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Once you’ve made a loaf of homemade yeast bread, you’ll never want to go back to buying packaged bread from the grocery store. Homemade bread tastes and smells heavenly and the baking process itself can be very rewarding. Store homemade bread in a paper or resealable plastic bag and eat within a day or two for best results. Bread that begins to get stale can be cubed and made into stuffing or croutons.</p>

  <p class="indent">Before you start baking, it’s helpful to understand the various components that make up bread.</p>

  <p class="h4"><a id="page_98"/><span class="bold">Wheat</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Wheat is the most common flour used in bread making, as it contains gluten in the right proportion to make bread rise. Gluten, the protein of wheat, is a gray, tough, elastic substance, insoluble in water. It holds the gas developed in bread dough by fermentation, which otherwise would escape. Though there are many ways to make gluten-free bread, flour that naturally contains gluten will rise more easily than gluten-free grains. In general, combining smaller amounts of other flours (rye, corn, oat, etc.) with a larger proportion of wheat flour will yield the best results.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/98-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/98-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">A grain of wheat consists of (1) an outer covering, or husk, which is always removed before milling; (2) bran, a hard shell that contains minerals and is high in fiber; (3) the germ, which contains the fat and protein content and is the part that can be planted and cultivated to grow more wheat; and (4) the endosperm, which is the wheat plant’s own food source and is mostly starch and protein. Whole wheat contains all of these components except for the husk. White flour is only the endosperm.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Yeast</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Yeast is a microscopic fungus that consists of spores, or germs. These spores grow by budding and division, multiply very rapidly under favorable conditions, and produce fermentation. Fermentation is the process by which, under influence of air, warmth, and a fermenting ingredient, sugar (or dextrose, starch converted into sugar) is changed into alcohol and carbon dioxide.</p>

    <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Background</span></p>

    <p class="indent">A grain is a single seed of a cereal grass. Some of the cereal grains grown in the United States are wheat, corn, rye, rice, barley, and oats. More foods are made with wheat than any other cereal grain.</p>

    <p class="indent">Each grain tastes differently and adds delicious taste, nutrition, and variety to meals. Grain-based foods provide complex carbohydrates, which are an important source of energy for the body.</p>

    <p class="indent">Grains also provide vitamins that help keep the body strong and healthy such as B vitamins, minerals such as iron, and dietary fiber, which keeps the digestive systems healthy. Grain products belong in the Breads, Cereals, Rice, and Pasta Group of the Food Guide Pyramid. The following are examples of grain-based foods categorized by their main grain ingredient.</p>

    <p class="h5"><a id="page_102"/><span class="bold">Setup and Introduction</span></p>

    <p class="nlist">1. Tell children that they will be playing a game about grains.</p>

    <p class="nlist">2. Explain that before they begin the Grain Game they will first need to understand that a grain is a seed from a cereal grass. Some cereal grains grown in the United States for food are wheat, corn, rice, oat, and rye (barley and millet are also cereal grains but are used less often in the United States).</p>

    <p class="nlist">3. Divide the group into two teams. The group leader should moderate the game. First, explain to children how the game is played:</p>

    <p class="blist1"><span class="red">•</span>   The group leader will call out a type of grain (e.g., wheat, corn, rice, oats, rye).</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   One team will begin the game by calling out a food made from that grain.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   The other team will respond by calling out a different food made from that grain.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Each time a correct food is called out, that team gets 1 point. When a team calls out an incorrect food, that team will not get a point but the point will go to the other team.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   The teams will alternate calling out a different food until no more can be named.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   When no more can be named, the group leader calls out the name of a new grain and the game continues.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Play rounds of this game until wheat, corn, rice, oats, and rye are covered.</p>

    <p class="box1hd"><a id="page_104"/><span class="bold">MILLING YOUR OWN GRAINS</span></p>

    <p class="indent">You can grind grains into flour at home using a mortar and pestle, a coffee or spice mill, manual or electric food grinders, a blender, or a food processor. Grains with a shell (quinoa, wheat berries, etc.) should be rinsed and dried before milling to remove the layer of resin from the outer shell that can impart a bitter taste to your flour. Rinse the grains thoroughly in a colander or mesh strainer, then spread them on a paper or cloth towel to absorb the extra moisture. Transfer to a baking sheet and allow to air dry completely (to speed this process you can put them in a very low oven for a few minutes). When the grains are dry, they’re ready to be ground.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="indent">Dry yeast is most commonly used for baking. Most grocery stores sell regular active dry and instant yeast. Instant yeast is more finely ground and thus absorbs the moisture faster, speeding up the leavening process and making the bread rise more rapidly.</p>

  <p class="indent">Active dry yeast should be proofed before using. Mix one packet of active dry yeast with ¼ cup warm water and 1 teaspoon sugar. Stir until yeast dissolves. Allow it to sit for 5 minutes, or until it becomes foamy.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Making Bread</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Making bread is a fairly simple process, though it does require a chunk of time. Keep in mind, though, that you can be doing other things while the bread is rising or baking. The process is fairly straightforward and only varies slightly by kind of bread.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mix together the flour, sugar, salt, and any other dry ingredients. Form a well in the center and add the dissolved yeast and any other wet ingredients. Mix all the ingredients together.</p>

  <p class="indent">Gather the dough into a ball and place it on a lightly floured surface. Flour your hands to keep the dough from sticking to your fingers. Knead the dough by folding it toward you and then pushing it away with the palms of your hands. Continue kneading for five to ten minutes, or until the dough is soft and elastic.</p>

  <p class="indent">Place the dough in a lightly greased pan, cover with a dish towel, and allow to rise in a warm place until it doubles in size.</p>

  <p class="indent">Punch the dough down to expel the air and place it in a greased and lightly floured baking pan. Cover and let rise a second time until it doubles in size.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bake the bread in a preheated oven according to the recipe. Bread is done when it is golden brown and sounds hollow when you tap the top.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/104-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">Remove bread from the pan by loosening the sides with a knife or spatula and tipping the pan upside down onto a wire rack.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Biscuits</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Any bread recipe can be made into biscuits instead of one large loaf. To shape bread dough into biscuits, pull or cut off pieces, making them all as close to uniform in size as possible. Flour palms of hands slightly and shape each piece individually. Using the thumb and first two fingers of one hand, and holding it in the palm of the other hand, move the dough round and round, folding the dough towards the center. When smooth, turn it over and roll between palms of hands. Place in greased pans nearly together, brushed between with a little melted butter, which will allow biscuits to separate after baking.</p>

    <p class="box1hd"><span class="bold">GLUTEN-FREE BREAD</span></p>

    <p class="indent">Making good gluten-free bread isn’t always easy, but there are several things you can do to improve your chances of success:</p>

    <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/105-1.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="blist1"><span class="red">•</span>   Choose flours that are high in protein, such as sorghum, amaranth, millet, teff, oatmeal, and buckwheat</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Use all room temperature ingredients. Yeast thrives in warm environments.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Add a couple teaspoons of xantham gum to your dry ingredients.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Add eggs and dry milk powder to your bread. These will add texture and help the bread to rise.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Crush a vitamin C tablet and add it to your dry ingredients. The acidity will help the yeast do its job.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Substitute carbonated water or gluten-free beer for other liquids in the recipe.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   If you’re following a traditional bread recipe, add extra liquid (water, carbonated water, milk, fruit juice, or olive oil) to get a soft and sticky consistency. The batter should be a little too sticky to knead. For this reason, bread machines are great for making gluten-free bread.</p>

    <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Family Taste Celebration</span></p>

    <p class="indent"><span class="bold">Many families use special foods for family gatherings and celebrations big and small. Take a few minutes to think about the special foods you prepare.</span></p>

    <p class="indent">Encourage your child to explore his or her food heritage. Often, foods that were prepared as everyday foods many years ago have become today’s celebration foods. For example, great grandmom’s crumb cake, which she made every week, you may make once a year as part of a holiday breakfast. Or the homemade ravioli that was made weekly has been replaced by the store-bought variety. Suggest that your child talk to older family members about the foods they or their grandparents ate when they were younger.</p>

    <p class="indent">Here are a few questions to get them started:</p>

    <p class="indent">What countries did our relatives come from?___________________________________________</p>

    <p class="indent">What recipes or foods did you eat when you were younger that can be traced back to these countries?___________________________________________</p>

    <p class="indent">Do you have any recipes that have been handed down from generation to generation?___________________________________________</p>

    <p class="indent">Discuss with your child what was discovered about his or her family food heritage. Discuss the family recipes and make a shopping list for one of these recipes. Have your child track down the ingredients when you go to the grocery store. Together with your child, prepare the recipe and enjoy a celebration of family history.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Keep an apple in your brown sugar. Store the pair in a tightly closed container and the sugar will stay soft and moist.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Roll out your pastry dough on waxed paper. Use a sponge to dampen the work surface before placing the paper on it. Dust the paper with flour and draw a circle in the flour slightly larger your pie pan. Once the pastry is rolled to the size of your circle, pick up the paper and pastry, flip it upside down into your pan, and then pull the paper away from the crust.</p>

    <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/118-1.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Run a measuring cup under hot water for a few seconds before using it to measure honey, oil, nut butters, etc.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Never grease the cake pan when making sponge, angel food, or chiffon cakes. For other sorts of cakes, greasing the pan will help the cakes to rise evenly and slide out of the pan without falling part.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   To tell if a cake is done, stick a sharp knife into the center and pull it out. If the knife is dry, the cake is done.</p>

    <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/118-2.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   To easily peel peaches or plums for use in pies, dip them in boiling water for a few seconds. The peels will slide right off.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Leftover pie dough can be slathered with butter and jam, rolled into a log, and then cut in slices and baked until golden.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   To prevent the bottom pie crust from getting soggy from berries or other juicy fruits, brush the crust with an egg white. You can also brush the top crust with egg white to create a golden glaze.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Pie crusts roll out best when the dough is kept cold. To this end, you can substitute a bottle filled with ice water for the rolling pin.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   To make cookies soft and chewy, pull them out of the oven while the centers are still slightly gooey. Allow to cool on the pan for a few minutes, and then move to a cooling rack.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Most cookie dough can be stored in the freezer for up to three months. Thaw in the refrigerator before using.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   To make egg whites stiffen more quickly, add a pinch of salt before beating.</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   When separating eggs, if a bit of egg yolk slips into the whites, moisten a cloth with cold water and touch it to the yolk. The yolk will stick to the cloth.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="id25"><a id="page_124"/><span class="bold">Eating Well</span></p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Why Eat Organically Grown Food?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Organically grown produce is becoming more and more readily available, regardless of where you live. If you grow your own fruits and vegetables or have ready access to a farmers’ market, eating organically may be cheaper than purchasing commercially grown produce at the supermarket. Though organic foods bought at a grocery store may be 10 to 50 percent more expensive than their traditionally grown companions, the benefits are often worth the cost. Here are just a few of many reasons to eat organically grown produce:</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/124-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/124-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="blist1"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">Improved taste.</span> Tests comparing various gardening methods have shown that fruit grown organically has a higher natural sugar content and firmer flesh, and is less apt to bruise easily. Do your own taste test and you’ll easily tell the difference!</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">Fewer health risks.</span> Pesticides have been linked to cancer and other diseases.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">Help support smaller farms.</span> Most organic farms are small, family-owned endeavors. By purchasing organic produce, you’ll be helping them survive and thrive.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">Help the environment.</span> According to the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), agriculture is responsible for 70 percent of the pollution in the United States’ streams and rivers. Organic farmers don’t use the synthetic pesticides and fertilizers that cause this pollution.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">Better nutrition.</span> Higher levels of lycopene, polyphenols, and flavonols have been found in organically produced fruits and vegetables. Phytonutrients (many of which are antioxidants involved in the plant’s own defense system) may be higher in organic produce because crops rely more on their own defenses in the absence of regular applications of chemical pesticides.</p>

  <p class="img"><a id="page_125"/><img alt="images" src="../Images/125-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Why Eat Locally Grown Food?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Even if you grow the majority of your own produce, you may want to supplement your menu with food from other sources. When doing so, there are lots of great reasons to choose foods grown near where you live. Here are a few:</p>

  <p class="blist1"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">Support the local economy.</span> According to a study by the New Economics Foundation in London, a dollar spent locally generates twice as much income for the local economy.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">Fresher food.</span> Produce you buy at the supermarket has likely been in transit for several days or even weeks, and during that time it’s been declining in flavor and nutrition. Produce you buy from a farmers’ market or local farm stand was likely picked the same day.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">Help the environment.</span> By eating food grown locally, you’re cutting down on the number of miles it had to travel to get to you, thus lowering fuel emissions.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">Stay attuned to the seasons.</span> Eating locally means that you may not get asparagus in October or sweet potatoes in April, but those foods will not be at their best quality in those months anyway. You’ll get more nutritious, better tasting food if you eat it at its growing peak. You’ll also feel more connected to the natural seasonal rhythms.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">Encourage variety.</span> By supporting the local farmers, you give them the opportunity to try less common or heirloom varieties that wouldn’t travel as well, produce as high a yield, or have the shelf life of most supermarket varieties.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="id26"><a id="page_127"/><span class="bold">Food Co-ops: Grocery Shopping in Community</span></p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">What Is a Food Co-op?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Food co-ops are non-profit, democratic, and member-owned businesses that provide low-cost organic or natural foods to members and, in some cases, non-members.</p>

  <p class="indent">Since food co-ops are established and operated by members, each member has a voice regarding what types of foods will be sold, maintenance issues, and management of the stores. Food co-ops are democratically run, so each member has one vote in any type of election. Members generally elect a board of directors to oversee the everyday running of the co-op and to hire staff.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">What Are the Different Types of Food Co-ops?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Typically, there are two types of food co-ops: the co-op grocery store and the buying club. Each is owned and run by members but they do vary in their structure and number of members.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Co-op Grocery Store</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Co-op grocery stores are basically regular grocery stores that are member-owned and -operated and provide low cost, healthy foods to members and often to the public as well. There are around 500 co-op grocery stores in the United States alone.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Buying Club</span></p>

  <p class="indent">A buying club consists of a small group of people (friends, neighbors, families, or colleagues) who get together and buy food in bulk from a co-op distributor (a co-op warehouse or natural foods distributor) or from local farms. By ordering in bulk, the members are able to save money on grocery items. The members of the buying club share the responsibilities of collecting money from the other members, placing orders with the distributor, picking up the orders from the drop-off site, and distributing the food to the individual members or families.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/127-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_128"/><span class="bold">How Do You Become a Food Co-op Member?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">In order to become a member of a food co-op, you must pay a small initial fee and then typically invest a certain amount of money into the co-op to purchase a share. Sometimes members can accumulate more shares (by paying an annual fee, for example). Members can also help run the co-op by volunteering their time. Members reap the benefits of their membership by having access to discounted prices on food products. However, if you decide not to become a member, some food co-ops still allow non-members to shop at their stores without the membership discount.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">How Do You Become a Buying Club Member?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">If you are looking to join a buying club in your area, it is best to contact your regional co-op distributor and ask them for information on local buying clubs. Check out the Web sites of local distributors to see if they have links to buying clubs near you. Or ask friends and neighbors if they’re aware of any buying clubs that are active in your area.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">How Do You Start Your Own Food Co-op?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Here are some steps to follow in order to establish your own food co-op:</p>

  <p class="nlist1">1. Invite potential members to meet and discuss the start-up of a food co-op. Identify how a food co-op may help the finances of the members.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Hold a meeting in which potential members vote to continue the process of forming a co-op and then select a committee for this purpose.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. Determine how often the co-op will be used by the potential members.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Discuss the results of any surveys at another meeting and then vote to see if the plans should proceed.</p>

  <p class="indent">To start your own buying club, you will need to collect a group of people (preferably more than five households). If no one in your new group has any experience with organizing a buying club, it may be beneficial for you to temporarily join a buying club to see how it works. Once you are confident in your understanding of a buying club, it’s time to begin!</p>

  <p class="nlist1">1. Find a co-op distributor’s (wholesaler’s) pricing guide to share with the others in your buying club, so you all have an understanding of the products available and the savings from which you’ll benefit. If you’ll be buying from local farms, discuss pricing and bulk discounts with the farmers.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Have a meeting and invite all those who are interested in joining your buying club. Emphasize that a buying club requires its members to share in all responsibilities—from placing orders to picking up deliveries to collecting the money—and that they will all reap the benefits of obtaining great organic and natural foods at wholesale prices.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. Establish an organizational committee. Discuss areas such as coordination, price guide distribution, orderings, potential delivery location, what supplies will be needed, bookkeeping, and how to orient new members.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Draw up any membership requirements you think necessary.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5. Brainstorm possible delivery sites, such as churches, firehouses, or other public buildings. Your optimal site should be able to accommodate a large truck and have long hours of operation. Make sure you will have enough space at the site to go through the products and distribute them accordingly.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6. Develop a name for your buying club and fill out a membership application with the co-op distributor of your choice. You should receive some sort of confirmation, complete with order deadlines, date of delivery, and a simple orientation to the buying club.</p>

  <p class="nlist">7. Start enjoying your healthy foods for lower prices!</p>

  <p class="h2" id="id27"><a id="page_130"/><span class="bold">Maple Sugaring</span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="dcap">T</span>he production of maple syrup and maple sugar is purely an American industry, Canada being the only country outside of the United States where they are made. The earliest explorers in this country found the Native Americans making sugar from maple trees, and in some sections producing it in quantity for trade. The settlers began to make maple products as well and to attempt to improve their manufacture. For many years, maple sugar was the only sugar used, and despite refinements, beyond the tapping and boiling, the general process remains the same as at that time.</p>

  <p class="indent">All the maples have sweet sap, but only from a few of the species has sugar been made in worthwhile quantities. The first place is held by the sugar maple and a variety of it—the black maple. These can be found in the Northeastern region of the United States, as well as the northern Midwest. Other varieties, including the red maple, the silver maple, and the Oregon maple, can be tapped, but will produce smaller quantities of syrup. It takes approximately 40 gallons of sap to make 1 gallon of syrup, so it is generally not worthwhile to tap the less productive tree varieties.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Tapping</span></p>

  <p class="indent">The quantity of sap that a tree yields stands in direct relation to the size of its crown. It is good to make it a rule to tap only one place on a tree; by doing so the life of the tree is prolonged. Large trees might be tapped in two and sometimes three places without injury, but not in two places so near together that the sap from the two is collected in one bucket. Each hole should heal over in as quickly as one season.</p>

  <p class="indent">Before tapping, the side of the tree should be brushed with a stiff broom to remove all loose bark and dirt and a spot selected where the bark looks healthy, some distance from the scar of a previous tapping. Care should also be taken to tap where a bucket attached to the spout inserted in the hole will hang level and be partly supported by the tree itself. The distance from the ground should be about waist high, convenient for the sap collector. In general it is best to tap on the side of the tree where other trees do not shade the spot. The main requisite in tapping a tree is a good sharp bit with which a clean-cut hole can be made. A rough, feathered hole soon becomes foul, stopping the flow. After the tapping, all shavings should be removed to make the hole clean. The bark should never be cut away before boring the hole, as this shortens the life of the tree.</p>

  <p class="indent">General practice concerning the size of the hole seems to indicate that three-eighths to half an inch is the best dia-meter; then, if the season is long and a warm spell interrupts the flow, the holes can be reamed out to one-half to five-eighths of an inch, and thereby secure an increased run. A thirteen thirty-seconds of an inch bit is often used. The bit should be especially sharp and should bring the shavings to the surface. Its direction is slightly upward into the tree. The slant allows the hole to drain readily.</p>

  <p class="indent">The depth of the hole should be regulated by the size of the tree, as only the layers next to the bark are alive and contain enough sap to flow freely. Toward the interior the flow diminishes. With the ordinary tree a hole less than 1½ to 2 inches deep is best. In small trees make a short incision just through the sapwood. In any case boring should be stopped when dark colored shavings appear, as this shows dead wood and that the sapwood has been passed through. It is good policy to tap early in the season in order to obtain the earlier runs, which are generally the sweetest. “Sugar weather” begins sometime between mid-February to mid-March, when the days are becoming warm, the temperature going above 32° F, and the nights are still frosty.</p>

  <p class="indent">The spout, or spile, is the tube through which the sap flows into the bucket. It is usually of metal, but hollow reeds are sometimes used. The best are perfectly cylindrical and of an even taper, making them easy to insert and to remove without interfering with the wood tissue. The perfect spout should be strong enough to support the bucket of sap safely, and for obvious reasons should bring the whole weight on the bark of the tree and not on the inner tissue or sapwood. A spout should have a hook or stop on which the bucket is to hang, unless the bucket may hang on the spout itself, and it is best to have a spout with a small hole, because one with a large hole allows the bore to dry out faster when there are strong winds. Buckets are typically of galvanized metal (free from corrosion or rust, covered, and fitting well to the tree). Sometimes old plastic one-gallon milk cartons are used, since their narrow neck prevents debris from entering. Make sure to clean any container thoroughly before use.</p>

  <p class="indent">The sap should be collected each day and not be allowed to accumulate. It is also necessary to keep the buckets and containers clean, and they should be washed in warm water after each run. So long as it is cold, you may store the sap outdoors for up to three days in any large metal or plastic container. When pouring the sap into its collecting device, stretch a flannel cloth over the top of the tanks and pour the sap through this to remove any twigs, leaves, or pieces of dirt.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Syrup and Sugar Making</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Once you have enough sap to start making syrup, you may start to boil it down. Use any outdoor method, from bonfire to coal-burning range, camp stove to commercial evaporator, but avoid boiling sap inside, as it results in a sticky residue on your walls.</p>

  <p class="indent">Use two pans, one to evaporate excess moisture from the sap and concentrate it into syrup, and one as a finishing pan, in which you will finish boiling it. The evaporator should have a large bottom surface area, and the sap should not be deeper than 1 to 1½ inches in the pan at any time. The size of the pan depends on how much sugaring you intend to do—it is best if it can hold at least one gallon. Put in an inch or two of sap, boil, and add more, a little at a time, so as not to stop boiling or materially change the density of the boiling liquid; then, when this charge is concentrated, or has reached approximately 6 degrees above the temperature at which water boils (use a candy thermometer to monitor it), the syrup should be drawn off. Care must be exercised not to allow the remaining syrup in the pan to he burned. While evaporating, use a kitchen strainer to skim off the froth, and keep a spoon for stirring on hand.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/130-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_131"/>To finish the syrup, pour it through a piece of felt cloth, or two pieces of thick flannel, into the finishing pot. Once the syrup has reached 7 degrees above the boiling point of water, it is ready for storage.</p>

  <p class="indent">Glass containers are the best method for keeping syrup, although airtight plastic and metal containers will also work. When carefully canned, syrup will keep from one season to another without souring or bursting the jar. It is best to store syrup immediately after finishing, while still hot, and then keep at an even, cold temperature. Temperatures around freezing, however, should not be used, as this may crystallize the syrup.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Sugaring-off” applies to the further treatment of the maple syrup by which it is made into a solid product. The ordinary iron pot of the kitchen is filled nearly half full with the syrup and this concentrated over the fire. Use a candy thermometer to determine the proper point of stopping the boiling. In the first runs of sap the boiling should be carried up to 26 to 28 degrees above the boiling point of water at that elevation to make a medium hard sugar. With later runs the finishing temperature should be 28 to 38 degrees above the boiling point. After the thick syrup has reached the proper boiling point, it should be taken from the fire and stirred until somewhat cooled. This gives it a uniform grain and color in the mold. As in syrup making one should “sugar-off” a charge before adding any more syrup. The hardness of the sugar produced is to a large extent controlled by its moisture content. High temperatures are required to evaporate more of the water, but note that for softer sugars you should use slightly lower temperatures.</p>

  <p class="indent">Like brown sugar, maple sugar does not keep well in a moist atmosphere. It tends to absorb water, molds rather quickly, and if finished at too low a temperature the sugar is soft and the liquid portion drains out. Therefore sugar which is to be stored should always be boiled to a high temperature. It can be wrapped in paper, but should not be put in covered containers unless these are absolutely sealed. It is best to store the sugar in a warm room of even temperature. If the cakes are sealed without access to air, a cold place can be used, but make sure they are kept dry.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Edible Wild Mushrooms</span></p>

  <p class="indent">A walk through the woods will likely reveal several varieties of mushrooms, and chances are that some are the types that are edible. However, because some mushrooms are very poisonous, it is important never to try a mushroom of which you are unsure. Never eat any mushroom that you cannot positively identify as edible. Also, never eat mushrooms that appear wilted, damaged, or rotten.</p>

  <p class="indent">Here are some common edible mushroom that you can easily identify and enjoy.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Chanterelles</span></p>

  <p class="indent">These trumpet-shaped mushrooms have wavy edges and interconnected blunt-ridged gills under the caps. They are varied shades of yellow and have a fruity fragrance. They grow in summer and fall on the ground of hardwood forests. Because chanterelles tend to be tough, they are best when slowly sautéed or added to stews or soups.</p>

  <p class="indent">Notes: Beware of Jack O’Lantern mushrooms, which look and smell similarly to chanterelles. Jack O’Lanterns have sharp knifelike gills instead of the blunt gills of chanterelles, and generally grow in large clusters at the base of trees or on decaying wood.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Coral Fungi</span></p>

  <p class="indent">These fungi are aptly named for their bunches of upward-facing branching stems, which look strikingly like coral. They are whitish, tan, yellowish, or sometimes pinkish or purple. They may reach 8 inches in height. They grow in the summer and fall in shady, wooded areas.</p>

  <p class="indent">Notes: Avoid coral fungi that are bitter, have soft, gelatinous bases, or turn brown when you poke or squeeze them. These may have a laxative effect, though are not life-threatening.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Morels</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Morels are sometimes called sponge, pine cone, or honeycomb mushrooms because of the pattern of pits and ridges that appears on the caps. They can be anywhere from 2 to 12 inches tall. They may be yellow, brown, or black and grow in spring and early summer in wooded areas and on river bottoms. To cook, cut in half to check for insects, wash, and sauté, bake, or stew.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/138-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">Notes: False morels can be poisonous and appear similar to morels because of their brainlike irregularly shaped caps. However, they can be distinguished from true morels because false morel caps bulge inward instead of outward. The caps have lobes, folds, flaps, or wrinkles, but not pits and ridges like a true morel.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Puffballs</span></p>

  <p class="indent">These round or pear-shaped mushrooms are often mistaken for golf balls or eggs. They are always whitish, tan, or gray and sometimes have a thick stem. Young puffballs tend to be white and older ones yellow or brown. Fully matured puffballs have dark spores scattered over the caps. Puffballs are generally found in late summer and fall on lawns, in the woods, or on old tree stumps. To eat, peel off the outer skin and eat raw or batter-fried.</p>

  <p class="indent">Notes: Slice each puffball open before eating to be sure it is completely white inside. If there is any yellow, brown, or black, or if there is a developing mushroom inside with a stalk, gills, and cap, do not eat! Amanitas, which are very poisonous, can appear similar to puffballs when they are young. Do not eat if the mushroom gives off an unpleasant odor.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/138-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="bold">Chanterelles</span></p>

  <p class="h4"><a id="page_139"/><span class="bold">Shaggy Mane Mushrooms</span></p>

  <p class="indent">This mushroom got its name from its cap, which is a white cylinder with shaggy, upturned, brownish scales. As the mushroom matures, the bottom outside circumference of the cap becomes black. Shaggy manes are generally 4 to 6 inches tall and grow in all the warm seasons in fields and on lawns.</p>

  <p class="indent">Shaggy manes are tastiest eaten when young, but they’re easiest to identify once the bottoms of the caps begin to turn black. They are delicious sautéed in butter or olive oil and lightly seasoned with salt, garlic, or nutmeg.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="id29"><a id="page_140"/><span class="bold">Making Sausage</span></p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Important Considerations in Sausage Making</span></p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Temperatures</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Meat products are extremely perishable and must be maintained under refrigeration (40ºF or below). When you have finished processing a product, return it to the refrigerator. After the product has been formulated, smoke and cook the product to the required temperature and then return the product to refrigeration. Sausage that hasn’t been properly refrigerated will spoil and can make you sick.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Sanitation</span></p>

  <p class="indent">There is no substitute for keeping the tables, utensils, and ingredients clean and free from dirt and contamination. Use plenty of hot water and soap before and after processing sausages. Always keep your hands clean.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Taking Notes</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Just as you keep a copy of a good recipe, you should keep notes on the formulation and processing procedures of your favorite smoked and cooked sausage. Ingredients, times, temperatures, and end results should be noted. This will help to make a better sausage the next time.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Fat Content</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Different sausages have different amounts of fat. Avoid making the formula too lean as the sausage will be dry and hard. Fresh pork sausage contains 30 to 45 percent fat. Smoked or roasted sausage contains 20 to 30 percent fat. Formulate the fat content just as you would the other ingredients in a sausage.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Nitrates and Nitrites</span></p>

  <p class="indent">These curing ingredients are required to achieve the characteristic flavor, color, and stability of cured meat. Nitrate and nitrite are converted to nitric oxide by microorganisms and combine with the meat pigment myoglobin to give the cured meat color. However, more importantly, nitrite provides protection against the growth of botulism-producing organisms, acts to show rancidity, and stabilizes the flavor of the cured meat. Potassium nitrate (saltpeter) was the salt historically used for curing. However, we now know that saltpeter is much stronger than necessary for curing meat.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/140-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">Much controversy has surrounded the use of nitrite in recent years—for good reason. Too many nitrites can cause all sorts of health problems, including cancer. However, the amount used in sausage making is not enough to cause concern and is far less of a worry than the botulism that can result if it is not used. A commercial premixed cure can be used when nitrate or nitrite is called for in the recipe. The premixes have been diluted with salt so that the small quantities of nitrites and nitrates can more easily be weighed. This reduces the possibility of serious error in handling pure nitrate or nitrite. Several premixes are available. Many local grocery stores stock Morton® Tender Quick® Product and other brands of premix cure.</p>

  <p class="indent">Because the amount of premixed cure will vary depending on what brand is used, it is important to follow the directions on the package. The recipes below are only for fresh sausage, which does not require a cure. Fresh sausage is delicious, simple to make, and can be frozen if you do not want to cook and serve it right away.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Storage</span></p>

  <p class="indent">The length of time a sausage can be stored depends on the type of sausage. Fresh sausage is highly perishable and will only last seven to ten days. However, it may be frozen for four to six months if wrapped in moisture-vapor proof wrap (freezer paper). Smoked sausages may last from two to four weeks under refrigeration.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Fresh Pork Sausage</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Fresh pork sausage is a mixture of pork meats, salt, and spices which have been ground or chopped with no added water or extenders. Fat content usually ranges from 35 to 50 percent depending upon individual preference. For a spicier sausage, add a teaspoon of crushed red pepper or ½ teaspoon ground red pepper.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="id30"><span class="bold">Curing Virginia Ham</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Meat has been preserved for centuries by drying, salting, and curing. Virginia ham was one of the first agricultural products exported from North America. Today, Virginia ham is still loved around the world for its distinctive savory taste. To cure ham at home, a few simple rules should be followed.</p>

  <div class="box0">
    <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/141-4.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="cap"><span class="bold">Figure 1 is a “Country Style” ham. This ham has a long shank (solidbone) and a buttcut at the sacral joint. This style of cutting leaves less lean meat exposed in the shank and butt areas, which reduces the possibility of spoilage.</span></p>

    <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/141-5.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="cap"><span class="bold">Figure 2 is a “Regular” cut ham. This style of cut is satisfactory for curing and aging hams under conditions of controlled temperature and humidity. The shank is cut short, exposing an open bone with marrow and lean tissue around the bone. The butt is cut between the second and third Sacral Vertebrae which results in a larger lean cut butt face than on “Country Style” hams.</span></p>

    <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/141-6.jpg"/></p>
  </div>

  <p class="h5"><a id="page_142"/><span class="bold">Start with a Good Ham</span></p>

  <p class="indent">To get a high quality cured ham, you have to start with a high quality fresh ham. Choose ham from young, healthy, fast-growing hogs with a desirable lean-to-fat ratio. If you are not butchering your own animal, fresh hams can be purchased from grocery stores or a local butcher. Hams for curing should have a long thick cushion (Figure 1), a deep and wide butt face, minimal seam, and external fat as seen on the collar (Figure 1) and alongside the butt face (Figure 3A), and weigh less than 24 pounds. Heavier hams are normally fatter and are more likely to spoil before the cure adjuncts penetrate to prevent deterioration.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Keep the Hams Properly Chilled</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Fresh hams should be kept chilled below 40°F before being cured and then kept between 36° and 40°F during curing.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Cure Application</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Hams can be cured in just salt, or you can add a dry sugar cure for a richer, sweeter flavor. For each 25 lbs. of fresh meat, use:</p>

  <p class="blist1"><span class="red">•</span>   2 pounds salt</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   ½ pound sugar</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   ½ ounce coarse kosher salt</p>

  <div class="box0">
    <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/142-1.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="cap"><span class="bold">Figure 3A illustrates a high-quality ham that has a firm, bright-colored lean with at least a small amount of marbling (specks of fat in the lean) in the butt face.</span></p>

    <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/142-2.jpg"/></p>

    <p class="cap"><span class="bold">Figure 3B reveals the type of ham to avoid. Its muscles are soft, usually pale in color and lack marbling. They also “weep” excessively and will shrink more during curing. The open seams between the muscles allow bacterial and insect invasion</span>.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/142-3.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">Mix these ingredients thoroughly and divide into two equal parts. Apply the first half on day one and the second portion on day seven of the curing period. Rub the curing mixture into all lean surfaces (Figure 1) of the ham. Cover the skin and fat (little will be absorbed through these surfaces).</p>

  <p class="indent">Virginia style hams should be cured seven days per inch of cushion depth (Figure 3A), or one and a half days per pound of ham. Keep accurate records of placing hams in cure and mark on your calendar when it’s time to remove hams from cure. During the curing period, keep hams at a temperature of 36 to 40°F.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">After Curing—Soak and Wash</span></p>

  <p class="indent">When the curing period has passed, the hams should be placed in a tub of clean, cold water for one hour. This will dissolve most of the surface curing mix and make the meat receptive to smoke. After soaking, scrub the ham with a stiff bristle brush and allow it to dry.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Cure Equalization</span></p>

  <p class="indent">After the ham has been washed, store it at 50-60°F for approximately fourteen days to permit the cure adjuncts to be distributed evenly throughout the ham. The product will shrink approximately 8–10 percent during cure application and equalization.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Final Steps</span></p>

  <p class="indent">In Southeastern Virginia, most hams are smoked to accelerate drying and to give added flavor. The Smithfield ham is smoked for a long time at a low temperature (under 90°F). Wood from hardwood species of trees (trees that shed their leaves in the fall) should be used to produce the smoke. Hickory is the most popular, but apple, plum, peach, oak, maple, beech, ash, or cherry may be used. Pine, cedar, spruce, and other “needle leaf” trees are <span class="italic">not</span> to be used for smoking meat since they give off resin which has a bitter taste and odor.</p>

  <p class="indent">The fire should be a “cool” smoldering type that produces dense smoke. The temperature of the smokehouse should be kept below 90°F. Hams should be hung in a smokehouse* so that they do not touch each other. Smoke until they become chestnut brown in color, which may take one to three days.</p>

  <p class="indent">In Southwest Virginia, hams are not traditionally smoked after curing, washing, and equalizing. Instead, the final step is to rub hams with the following mixture.</p>

  <p class="indent">For 25 lbs. of ham:</p>

  <p class="blist1"><span class="red">•</span>   ½ pound black pepper</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   1 cup molasses</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   ¼ pound of brown sugar</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   ¼ ounce coarse kosher salt</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   ¼ ounce of cayenne pepper</p>

  <p class="indent">Then bag the hams as shown.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Age the Hams for 45 to 180 Days</span></p>

  <p class="indent">As with wine or cheese, it is during the aging process that rich flavor develops. Age hams for 45 to 180 days at 75 to 95°F and a relative humidity of 55 to 65 percent. Use an exhaust fan controlled by a humidistat to limit mold growth and prevent excessive drying. Air circulation is needed, particularly during the first seven to ten days of aging, to dry the ham surface. Approximately 8 to 12 percent of the initial weight is lost.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Pests</span></p>

  <p class="indent">As unpleasant as it is to think about, it’s important to know that pests are drawn to cured meat and can ruin all your hard work if you don’t take certain precautions. The insects attracted to cured meat are the cheese skipper, larder beetle, and red-legged ham beetle. Mites, which are not officially insects, also may infest cured meats.</p>

  <p class="img"><a id="page_143"/><img alt="images" src="../Images/143-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="red">1. <span class="bold">Cheese Skipper</span></span></p>

  <p class="indent">This insect gets its name from the jumping habit of the larvae which bore through cheese and cured meats. Meat infested with this insect quickly rots and becomes slimy. Adult flies are two-winged and are one-third the size of houseflies. They lay their eggs on meat and cheese and multiply rapidly.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="red">2. <span class="bold">Larder Beetle</span></span></p>

  <p class="indent">This insect is dark brown and has a yellowish band across its back. The adult is about ⅓ inch long. Its larvae feed on or immediately beneath the cured meat surface, but do not rot the meat. The larvae are fuzzy, brownish, and about ⅓ inch long at maturity.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="red">3. <span class="bold">Red-Legged Ham Beetle</span></span> The larvae are purplish and about ⅓ inch long. They bore through the meat and cause it to dry rot. Adults are about ¼ inch long, brilliant greenish blue with red legs and are red at the bases of their antennae. They feed on the meat surface.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="red">4. <span class="bold">Mites</span></span> Mites are whitish and about <span class="super">1</span>/<span class="sub">32</span> inch long at maturity. Affected parts of meat infested with mites appear powdery.</p>

  <p class="indent1">To help prevent insect and mite infestation, start the curing and aging during cold weather when these insects are inactive. Proper cleaning of the aging and storage areas is essential since the cheese skipper feeds and breeds on grease and tiny scraps of meat lodged in cracks. Cracks should be sealed with putty or plastic wood after cleaning.</p>

  <p class="indent">Screens should be installed to prevent entrance of flies, ants, and other insects that carry mites.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/143-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">Double entry doors are recommended to reduce infestation of insects.</p>

  <p class="indent">If any product becomes infested after precautions have been taken, it should be removed from the storeroom and the infested area should be trimmed. The trim should be deep enough to remove larvae that have penetrated along the bone and through the fat. The uninfested portion is safe to eat, but should be prepared and consumed promptly. The exposed lean of the trimmed areas should be protected by greasing it with salad oil or melted fat to delay molding or drying.</p>

  <p class="indent">Protect the hams by placing a barrier between the meat and the insects. Heavy brown grocery bags with no rips or tears in them are ideal to use for this purpose. Place the ham in a bag and fold and tie the top. Then, place the bagged ham in a second bag, fold and tie. The hams wrapped by this method can be hung in a dry, cool, protected room to age. This room should be clean, tight, and well ventilated.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Preparing the Ham</span></p>

  <p class="indent">The traditional four-step method of preparing Virginia ham is to:</p>

  <p class="nlist1">1. Wash ham with a stiff bristled brush, removing as much of the salt as possible.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Place the ham in a large container, cover with cold water, and allow it to stand 10–12 hours or overnight.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. Lift the ham from the water and place it in a deep kettle with the skin side up and cover with fresh, cold water.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Cover the kettle, heat to a boil, but reduce heat as soon as the water boils. Simmer 20 to 25 minutes per pound until done.</p>

  <p class="indent1">Another method of cooking is to soak, scrub, and place the ham in a covered roaster, fat side up. Then, pour 2 inches of water into the roaster and place it in a 325°F oven. Cook approximately 20 to 25 minutes per pound. Baste frequently. Cook to an internal temperature of 155°F as indicated by a meat thermometer placed in the thickest position of the ham cushion. If you do not have a thermometer, test for doneness by moving the flat (pelvic) bone. It should move easily when ham is done. Lift ham from kettle. Remove skin. Sprinkle with brown sugar and/or bread crumbs and brown lightly in a 375°F oven, or use one of the suggested glazes.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="red"><span class="bold">Orange Glaze:</span></span> Mix 1 cup brown sugar, juice, and grated rind of one orange, spread over fat surface. Bake until lightly browned in a 375°F oven. Garnish with orange slices.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="red"><span class="bold">Mustard Glaze:</span></span> Mix ¼ cup brown sugar, 2 teaspoons prepared mustard, 2 tablespoons vinegar, and 1 tablespoon water. Spread over fat surface and bake as directed above.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="red"><span class="bold">Spice Glaze:</span></span> Use 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup juice from spiced peaches or crab apples. Bake as directed above. Garnish with the whole pickled fruit.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Cooking Ham Slices</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="red"><span class="bold">Baking:</span></span> Place thick slice in covered casserole and bake in 325°F oven. Brown sugar and cloves, fruit juice, or mustard-seasoned milk may be used over the ham during baking. Uncover the last 15 to 20 minutes for browning.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="red"><span class="bold">Broiling:</span></span> Score fat edges and lay on broiler rack. Place 4 inches from broiler and broil for specified time, turning only once.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_144"/><span class="red"><span class="bold">Frying:</span></span> Trim the skin off the ham slices. Cut the outer edge of fat in several places to prevent it from curling during cooking. Place a small amount of fat in a moderately hot skillet. When it has melted, add ham slices. Cook ham slowly, turning often. Allow about 10 minutes total cooking time for thin slices. Remove ham from pan and add a small amount of water to raise the drippings for red-eye gravy. To decrease the salty taste, fry ham with a small amount of water in the skillet.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">How To Carve a Ham</span></p>

  <p class="indent">The most delightful flavor of Virginia ham can be enjoyed from thin slices. Thus, a very sharp knife, preferably long and narrow, is needed. With the ham on a platter, dressed side up, make a cut perpendicular to the bone about 6 inches in from the end of the hock. Then follow the steps in figure 8.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">How To Debone Cooked Ham</span></p>

  <p class="indent">The ham is easier to slice when the bones are removed while the ham is warm.</p>

  <p class="blist1"><span class="red">•</span>   Place skinned ham fat side down on three or four strips of firm white cloth 3 inches wide and long enough to reach around ham and tie. Do not tie until bone is removed.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Remove flat aitch bone (pelvic) by scalping around it.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Take sharp knife, and, beginning at hock end, cut to bone the length of ham. Follow bones with point of knife as you cut.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Loosen meat from bones. Remove bones.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Tie cloth strips together, pulling ham together as you tie.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Chill in the refrigerator overnight. Slice very thin, or have the ham sliced by machine.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Make Your Own Butter</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Making butter the old-fashioned way is incredibly simple and very gratifying. It’s a great project to do with kids, too. All you need are a jar, a marble, some fresh cream, and about 20 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist1">1. Start with about twice as much heavy whipping cream as you’ll want butter. Pour it into the jar, drop in the marble, close the lid tightly, and start shaking.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Check the consistency of the cream every three to four minutes. The liquid will turn into whipped cream, and then eventually you’ll see little clumps of butter forming in the jar. Keep shaking for another few minutes and then begin to strain out the liquid into another jar. This is buttermilk, which is great for use in making pancakes, waffles, biscuits, and muffins.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. The butter is now ready, but it will store better if you wash and work it. Add ½ cup of ice cold water and continue to shake for two or three minutes. Strain out the water and repeat. When the strained water is clear, mash the butter to extract the last of the water, and strain.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Scoop the butter into a ramekin, mold, or wax paper.</p>

  <p class="indent1">If desired, add salt or chopped fresh herbs to your butter just before storing or serving. Butter can also be made in a food processor or blender to speed up the processing time.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/145-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/145-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Make Your Own Yogurt</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Yogurt is basically fermented milk. You can make it by adding the active cultures <span class="italic">Streptococcus thermophilus</span> and <span class="italic">Lactobacillus bulgaricus</span> to heated milk, which will produce lactic acid, creating yogurt’s tart flavor and thick consistency. Yogurt is simple to make and is delicious on its own, as a dessert, in baked goods, or in place of sour cream.</p>

  <p class="indent">Yogurt is thought to have originated many centuries ago among the nomadic tribes of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. Milk stored in animal skins would acidify and coagulate. The acid helped preserve the milk from further spoilage and from the growth of pathogens (disease-causing microorganisms).</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Ingredients</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="italic">Makes 4 to 5 cups of yogurt</span></p>

  <p class="blist1"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">1 quart milk</span> (cream, whole, low-fat, or skim)—In general the higher the milk fat level in the yogurt, the creamier and smoother it will taste. <span class="bold">Note:</span> If you use home-produced milk it <span class="italic">must</span> be pasteurized before preparing yogurt. See box at the top of page for tips on pasteurizing milk.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">Nonfat dry milk powder</span>—Use ⅓ cup powder when using whole or low-fat milk, or use ⅔ cup powder when using skim milk. The higher the milk solids, the firmer the yogurt will be. For even more firmness add gelatin (directions below).</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">Commercial, unflavored, cultured yogurt</span>—Use ¼ cup. Be sure the product label indicates that it contains a live culture. Also note the content of the culture. <span class="italic">L. bulgaricus</span> and <span class="italic">S. thermophilus</span> are required in yogurt, but some manufacturers may in addition add <span class="italic">L. acidophilus</span> or <span class="italic">B. bifidum</span>. The latter two are used for slight variations in flavor, but more commonly for health reasons attributed to these organisms. All culture variations will make a successful yogurt.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">2 to 4 tablespoons sugar or honey (optional)</span></p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin (optional)</span>—For a thick, firm yogurt, swell 1 teaspoon gelatin in a little milk for 5 minutes. Add this to the milk and nonfat dry milk mixture before cooking.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Supplies</span></p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">Double boiler or regular saucepan</span>—1 to 2 quarts in capacity larger than the volume of yogurt you wish to make.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">Cooking or jelly thermometer</span>—A thermometer that can clip to the side of the saucepan and remain in the milk works best. Accurate temperatures are critical for successful processing.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">Mixing spoon</span></p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">Yogurt containers</span>—cups with lids or canning jars with lids.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   <span class="bold">Incubator</span>—a yogurt-maker, oven, heating pad, or warm spot in your kitchen. To use your oven, place yogurt containers into deep pans of 110°F water. Water should come at least halfway up the containers. Set oven temperature at lowest point to maintain water temperature at 110°F. Monitor temperature throughout incubation, making adjustments as necessary.</p>

  <p class="img"><a id="page_146"/><img alt="images" src="../Images/146-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Processing</span></p>

  <p class="nlist"><span class="bold">1. Combine ingredients and heat.</span> Heating the milk is necessary in order to change the milk proteins so that they set together rather than form curds and whey. Do not substitute this heating step for pasteurization. Place cold, pasteurized milk in top of a double boiler and stir in nonfat dry milk powder. Adding nonfat dry milk to heated milk will cause some milk proteins to coagulate and form strings. Add sugar or honey if a sweeter, less tart yogurt is desired. Heat milk to 200°F, stirring gently and hold for 10 minutes for thinner yogurt, or hold 20 minutes for thicker yogurt. Do not boil. Be careful and stir constantly to avoid scorching if not using a double boiler.</p>

  <p class="nlist"><span class="bold">2. Cool and inoculate.</span> Place the top of the double boiler in cold water to cool milk rapidly to 112 to 115°F. Remove 1 cup of the warm milk and blend it with the yogurt starter culture. Add this to the rest of the warm milk. The temperature of the mixture should now be 110 to 112°F.</p>

  <div class="box1">
    <p class="box1hd"><span class="bold">HOW TO PASTEURIZE RAW MILK</span></p>

    <p class="indent">If you are using fresh milk that hasn’t been processed, you can pasteurize it yourself. Heat water in the bottom section of a double boiler and pour milk into the top section. Cover the milk and heat to 165°F while stirring constantly for uniform heating. Cool immediately by setting the top section of the double boiler in ice water or cold running water. Store milk in the refrigerator in clean containers until ready for making yogurt.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="nlist"><span class="bold">3. Incubate.</span> Pour immediately into clean, warm containers; cover and place in prepared incubator. Close the incubator and incubate about 4 to 7 hours at 110°F, ± 5°F. Yogurt should set firm when the proper acid level is achieved (pH 4.6). Incubating yogurt for several hours past the time after the yogurt has set will produce more acidity. This will result in a more tart or acidic flavor and eventually cause the whey to separate.</p>

  <p class="nlist"><span class="bold">4. Refrigerate.</span> Rapid cooling stops the development of acid. Yogurt will keep for about ten to twenty-one days if held in the refrigerator at 40°F or lower.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Yogurt Types</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="red"><span class="bold">Set yogurt:</span></span> A solid set where the yogurt firms in a container and is not disturbed.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="red"><span class="bold">Stirred yogurt:</span></span> Yogurt made in a large container then spooned or otherwise dispensed into secondary serving containers. The consistency of the “set” is broken and the texture is less firm than set yogurt. This is the most popular form of commercial yogurt.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="red"><span class="bold">Drinking yogurt:</span></span> Stirred yogurt into which additional milk and flavors are mixed. Add fruit or fruit syrups to taste. Mix in milk to achieve the desired thickness. The shelf life of this product is four to ten days, since the pH is raised by the addition of fresh milk. Some whey separation will occur and is natural. Commercial products recommend a thorough shaking before consumption.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="red"><span class="bold">Fruit yogurt:</span></span> Fruit, fruit syrups, or pie filling can be added to the yogurt. Place them on top, on bottom, or stir them into the yogurt.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Troubleshooting</span></p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   If milk forms some clumps or strings during the heating step, some milk proteins may have jelled. Take the solids out with a slotted spoon or, in difficult cases, after cooking pour the milk mixture through a clean colander or cheesecloth before inoculation.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   When yogurt fails to coagulate (set) properly, it’s because the pH is not low enough. Milk proteins will coagulate when the pH has dropped to 4.6. This is done by the culture growing and producing acids. Adding culture to very hot milk (+115°F) can kill bacteria. Use a thermometer to carefully control temperature.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   If yogurt takes too long to make, it may be because the temperature is off. Too hot or too cold of an incubation temperature can slow down culture growth. Use a thermometer to carefully control temperature.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   If yogurt just isn’t working, it may be because the starter culture was of poor quality. Use a fresh, recently purchased culture from the grocery store each time you make yogurt.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   If yogurt tastes or smells bad, it’s likely because the starter culture is contaminated. Obtain new culture for the next batch.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Yogurt has over-set or incubated too long. Refrigerate yogurt immediately after a firm coagulum has formed.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   If yogurt tastes a little odd, it could be due to overheating or boiling of the milk. Use a thermometer to carefully control temperature.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   When whey collects on the surface of the yogurt, it’s called syneresis. Some syneresis is natural. Excessive separation of whey, however, can be caused by incubating yogurt too long or by agitating the yogurt while it is setting.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Storing Your Yogurt</span></p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Always pasteurize milk or use commercially pasteurized milk to make yogurt.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Discard batches that fail to set properly, especially those due to culture errors.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Yogurt generally has a ten- to twenty-one-day shelf life when made and stored properly in the refrigerator below 40°F.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Always use clean and sanitized equipment and containers to ensure a long shelf life for your yogurt. Clean equipment and containers in hot water with detergent, then rinse well. Allow to air dry.</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_147"/><span class="bold">Make Your Own Cheese</span></p>

  <p class="indent">There are endless varieties of cheese you can make, but they all fall into two main categories: soft and hard. Soft cheeses (like cream cheese) are easier to make because they don’t require a cheese press. The curds in hard cheeses (like cheddar) are pressed together to form a solid block or wheel, which requires more time and effort, but hard cheeses will keep longer than soft cheeses, and generally have a much stronger flavor.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cheese is basically curdled milk and is made by adding an enzyme (typically rennet) to milk, allowing curds to form, heating the mixture, straining out the whey, and finally pressing the curds together. Cheeses such as <span class="italic">queso fresco</span> or <span class="italic">queso blanco</span> (traditionally eaten in Latin American countries) and <span class="italic">paneer</span> (traditionally eaten in India), are made with an acid such as vinegar or lemon juice instead of bacterial cultures or rennet.</p>

  <p class="indent">You can use any kind of milk to make cheese, including cow’s milk, goat’s milk, sheep’s milk, and even buffalo’s milk (used for traditional mozzarella). For the richest flavor, try to get raw milk from a local farmer. If you don’t know of one near you, visit <a href="http://www.realmilk.com/where.html">www.realmilk.com/where.html</a> for a listing of raw milk suppliers in your state. You can use homogenized milk, but it will produce weaker curds and a milder flavor. If your milk is pasteurized, you’ll need to “ripen” it by heating it in a double boiler until it reaches 86°F and then adding 1 cup of unpasteurized, preservative-free cultured buttermilk per gallon of milk and letting it stand 30 minutes to three hours (the longer you leave it, the sharper the flavor will be). If you cannot find unpasteurized buttermilk, diluting ⅛ teaspoon calcium chloride (available from online cheesemaker suppliers) in ¼ cup of water and adding it to your milk will create a similar effect.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/147-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/147-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">Rennet (also called rennin or chymosin) is sold online at cheesemaking sites in tablet or liquid form. You may also be able to find Junket rennet tablets near the pudding and gelatin in your grocery store. One teaspoon of liquid rennet is the equivalent of one rennet tablet, which is enough to turn 5 gallons of milk into cheese (estimate four drops of liquid rennet per gallon of milk). Microbial rennet is a vegetarian alternative that is available for purchase online.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Preparation</span></p>

  <p class="indent">It’s important to keep your hands clean and all equipment sterile when making cheese.</p>

  <p class="nlist1">1. Wash hands and all equipment with soapy detergent before and after use.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Rinse all equipment with clean water, removing all soapy residue.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. Boil all cheesemaking equipment between uses.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. For best-quality cheese, use new cheesecloth each time you make cheese. (Sterilize cheesecloth by first washing, then boiling.)</p>

  <p class="nlist">5. Squeaky clean is clean. If you can feel a residue on the equipment, it is not clean.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Yogurt Cheese</span></p>

  <p class="indent">This soft cheese has a flavor similar to sour cream and a texture like cream cheese. A pint of yogurt will yield approximately ¼ pound of cheese. The yogurt cheese has a shelf life of approximately seven to fourteen days when wrapped and placed in the refrigerator and kept at less than 40°F. Add a little salt and pepper and chopped fresh herbs for variety.</p>

  <p class="nlist">1. Line a large strainer or colander with cheesecloth.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Place the lined strainer over a bowl and pour in plain, whole-milk yogurt. Do not use yogurt made with the addition of gelatin, as gelatin will inhibit whey separation.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. Let yogurt drain overnight, covered with plastic wrap. Empty the whey from the bowl.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Fill a strong plastic storage bag with some water, seal, and place over the cheese to weigh it down. Let the cheese stand another eight hours and then enjoy!</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="italic">Queso blanco</span> is a white, semi-hard cheese made without culture or rennet. It is eaten fresh and may be flavored with peppers, herbs, and spices. It is considered a “frying cheese,” meaning it does not melt and may be deep-fried or grilled. <span class="italic">Queso blanco</span> is best eaten fresh, so try this small recipe the first time you make it. If it disappears quickly, next time double or triple the recipe. This recipe will yield about ½ cup of cheese.</p>

  <p class="nlist1">1. Heat milk to 176°F for 20 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Add vinegar slowly to the hot milk until the whey is semi-clear and the curd particles begin to form stretchy clumps. Stir for 5 to 10 minutes. When it’s ready you should be able to stretch a piece of curd about ⅓ inch before it breaks.</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   ¼ cup fresh, plain yogurt (see recipe on <a href="../Text/006_Part002.html#page_150">page 150</a>)</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   One tablet rennet or 1 teaspoon liquid rennet dissolved in ½ cup tap water</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Brine: use 2 pounds of salt per gallon of water</p>

  <p class="nlist">1. Heat milk to 90°F and add yogurt. Stir slowly for 15 minutes while keeping the temperature constant.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Add rennet mixture and stir for 3 to 5 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. Cover, remove from heat, and allow to stand until coagulated, about 30 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Cut curd into ½-inch cubes. Allow to stand for 15 minutes with occasional stirring.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5. Return to heat and slowly increase temperature to 118°F over a period of 45 minutes. Hold this temperature for an additional 15 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6. Drain off the whey by transferring the mixture to a cheesecloth-lined colander. Use a spoon to press the liquid out of the curds. Transfer the mat of curd to a flat pan that can be kept warm in a low oven. Do not cut mat, but turn it over every 15 minutes for a 2-hour period. Mat should be tight when finished.</p>

  <p class="nlist">7. Cut the mat into long strips 1 to 2 inches wide and place in hot water (180°F). Using wooden spoons, tumble and stretch it under water until it becomes elastic, about 15 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">8. Remove curd from hot water and shape it by hand into a ball or a loaf, kneading in the salt. Place cheese in cold water (40°F) for approximately 1 hour.</p>

  <p class="nlist">9. Store in a solution of 2 teaspoons salt to 1 cup water.</p>

    <p class="nlist">1. Remove both ends of a large coffee can or thoroughly cleaned paint can, saving one end. Use an awl or a hammer and long nail to pierce the sides in several places, piercing from the inside out.</p>

    <p class="nlist">2. Place the can on a cooling rack inside a larger basin. Leave the bottom of the can in place.</p>

    <p class="nlist">3. Use a saw to cut a ¾-inch-thick circle of wood to create a “cheese follower.” It should be small enough in diameter to fit easily in the can.</p>

    <p class="nlist">4. Place cheese curds in the can, and top with the cheese follower. Place several bricks wrapped in cloth or foil on top of the cheese follower to weigh down curds.</p>

    <p class="nlist">5. Once the cheese is fully pressed, remove the bricks and bottom of the can. Use the cheese follower to push the cheese out of the can.</p>

    <p class="indent">Crackers are very easy to make and can be varied endlessly by adding seasonings of your choice. Try sprinkling a coarse sea salt and dried oregano or cinnamon and sugar over the crackers just before baking. Serve with homemade cheese.</p>

    <p class="blist1"><span class="red">•</span>   1½ cups all-purpose flour</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   1½ cups whole wheat flour</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   1 teaspoon salt</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   1 cup warm water</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   ⅓ cup olive oil</p>

    <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Herbs, spices, or coarse sea salt as desired</p>

    <p class="nlist1">1. Stir together the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl. Add the water and olive oil and knead until dough is elastic and not too sticky (about 5 minutes in an electric mixer with a dough attachment or 10 minutes by hand).</p>

    <p class="nlist">2. Allow dough to rest at room temperature for about half an hour. Preheat oven to 450°F.</p>

    <p class="nlist">3. Flour a clean, dry surface and roll dough to about ⅛ inch thick. Cut into squares and place on a cookie sheet. Sprinkle with desired topping. Bake for about 5 minutes or until crackers are golden brown.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Directions</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1. Combine milk and buttermilk and allow the mixture to ripen overnight.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. The next day, heat milk to 90ºF in a double boiler and add rennet.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. After about 45 minutes, cut curds into small cubes and let sit 15 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Heat very slowly to 100ºF and cook for about an hour or until a cooled piece of curd will keep its shape when squeezed.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5. Drain curds and rinse out the double boiler.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6. Place a rack lined with cheesecloth inside the double boiler and spread the curds on the cloth. Cover and reheat at about 98° F for 30 to 40 minutes. The curds will become one solid mass.</p>

  <p class="nlist">7. Remove the curds, cut them into 1-inch wide strips, and return them to the pan. Turn the strips every 15 to 20 minutes for one hour.</p>

  <p class="nlist">8. Cut the strips into cubes and mix in salt</p>

  <p class="nlist">9. Let the curds stand for 10 minutes, place them in cheesecloth, and press in a cheese press with 15 pounds for 10 minutes, then with 30 pounds for an hour.</p>

  <p class="nlist">10. Remove the cheese from the press, unwrap it, dip in warm water, and fill in any cracks.</p>

  <p class="nlist">11. Wrap again in cheesecloth and press with 40 pounds for twenty-four hours.</p>

  <p class="nlist">12. Remove from the press and let the cheese dry about five days in a cool, well-ventilated area, turning the cheese twice a day and wiping it with a clean cloth. When a hard skin has formed, rub with oil or seal with wax. You can eat the cheese after six weeks, but for the strongest flavor, allow cheese to age for six months or more.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Supplies</span></p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   1-pound coffee can</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   3-pound coffee can</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Duct tape</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   Ice</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   1 cup salt</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Ingredients</span></p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   2 cups half and half</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   ½ cup sugar</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   1 teaspoon vanilla</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Directions</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1. Mix all the ingredients in the 1-pound coffee can. Cover the lid with duct tape to ensure it is tightly sealed.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Place the smaller can inside the larger can and fill the space between the two with ice and salt.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. Cover the large can and seal with duct tape. Roll the can back and forth for 15 minutes. To reduce noise, place a towel on your working surface, or work on a rug.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Dump out ice and water. Stir contents of small can. Store ice cream in a glass or plastic container (if you leave it in the can it may take on a metallic flavor).</p>

  <p class="indent1">If desired, add cocoa powder, coffee granules, crushed peppermint sticks or other candy, or fruit.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Brew Your Own Root Beer</span></p>

  <p class="indent">The primary ingredients that give root beer its distinctive flavor are sassafras, vanilla, and wintergreen. Other optional ingredients include ginger, licorice, and sarsaparilla. Sassafras contains the chemical known as safrole, which has fairly recently been shown to be a carcinogen in laboratory animals and has been banned by the USDA. Though the amount of safrole you would consume in home brewed root beer is probably not enough to cause worry, it can’t hurt to use sassafrass extract that has had the safrole removed (available online and from some health food stores).</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/150-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">If you’re gathering your roots, be sure to rinse them thoroughly and cut thicker ones in half. When using leaves, be sure to use only the leaves and not the stems, roots, or flowers. Leaves should be rinsed thoroughly and then dried.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Root Beer</span></p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   ¼ ounce wintergreen leaves</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   ¼ ounce sarsaparilla root</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   ½ ounce sassafras root bark or 8 to 10 drops sassafras extract</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   1 1-inch piece ginger root, unpeeled and thinly sliced</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   ½ ounce burdock root</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   ¼ ounce licorice root</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   ⅛ teaspoon active dry yeast</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   1 cup molasses</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   1 cup sugar</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>

  <p class="blist"><span class="red">•</span>   1 gallon water</p>

  <p class="nlist1">1. Place roots and leaves in 2 quarts water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and allow to steep for 2 hours.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Strain through a cheesecloth-lined strainer into a clean pot. Discard roots and leaves. Add remaining 2 quarts of water to infused liquid.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. Add yeast, molasses, vanilla, and sugar to liquid, cover, and set aside to ferment for about 20 minutes.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Use a funnel to fill four 1-liter plastic soda bottles. Leave at least 2 inches of space at the top of each bottle. Screw on lids and store at room temperature for 12 hours.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5. Chill root beer in the refrigerator for at least two days, or until it reaches the desired fizziness. After four or five days the root beer will become slightly alcoholic. Remove caps slowly to allow gas to escape gradually.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Plant a Row for the Hungry (PAR) Program</span></p>

  <p class="indent">One in ten households in the United States experiences hunger or the risk of hunger every year. This is an astounding number of adults and children who are not receiving the proper foods, nutrients, and sustenance to maintain a healthy lifestyle. What can you do as a gardener to help provide fresh produce to the hungry in your community? Churches, schools, and other local organizations try to provide food for those who are hungry by giving to local food banks and shelters and by establishing soup kitchens and other programs. Often these food drives can only accept nonperishable items, but, recognizing the need for fresh fruits and vegetables in a healthy diet, many organizations are beginning to take produce on a conditional basis. If they can use the produce in their prepared meals or distribute them to needy families before the food begins to perish, they will accept it.</p>

  <p class="indent">Started in 1995 in Anchorage, Alaska, by Jeff Lowenfels as a public service program of the Garden Writers Association (GWA) and Foundation, PAR is a way for those who garden and grow their own vegetables and fruit to help combat hunger and poverty in their local communities. PAR encourages local gardeners to plant one extra row of produce in their gardens and then to donate that harvest to neighbors or others in the community who struggle to feed themselves and their families. Donating excess vegetables and fruit to your local food bank, soup kitchen, shelter, or other food agency to help feed the hungry in your local area is a wonderful way to share your love of gardening and to be an active and important member of your community.</p>

  <p class="indent">Anyone in the United States or Canada can participate in the PAR program, and members grow and donate over one million tons of food a year to help fight hunger in their local communities. Some people establish a community garden that solely grows food to give to local pantries and soup kitchens. Others simply grow additional crops and give individually to those in need.</p>

  <p class="indent">If you want to become involved in the PAR program, it is best to call or e-mail the GWA in order to receive more information about PAR programs in your area. It is also beneficial to call or visit local food agencies and see what crops they need most, or what types of fruits and vegetables they would like to provide for their customers. Most agencies seek out food that can be shelved for a few days if necessary and also foods that are high in nutritional value. They also accept fresh herbs that they can then use when making foods, such as soups. Flowers are also acceptable donations.</p>

  <p class="indent">When thinking about growing excess vegetables and fruit in your garden for donation, it is good to select easily grown crops that will help to maximize your harvest and will encourage you to be enthusiastic about growing and tending the plants. Some easily grown and highly desirable plants are: beans, cucumbers, peas, radishes, summer squash, and tomatoes. Then, once your produce is ready for harvesting, gather up the excess and take it to a selected PAR drop-off site or, if acceptable, directly to the food agency.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="images" src="../Images/151-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_152"/>There are some guidelines for growing fruits and vegetables that are acceptable for donation. Always be sure to contact your local food banks and soup kitchens for information on what they need in terms of fresh produce. Be sure to space your plantings apart so that your growing season and harvesting season are extended over a longer period of time. That way, you’ll be able to donate longer. Choose to grow produce that lasts well and stays fresher longer. Pick your ripe produce promptly and be sure to clean it of any dirt (but don’t wash it). And, of course, don’t ever give away overripe or spoiled produce.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">How to Start Your Own PAR Program</span></p>

  <p class="indent">What if your local community does not yet have a PAR program? It is easy to establish your own program by contacting PAR (either by e-mail, by visiting the GWA website, or by calling toll free; see contact information below). This way, you will be able to gain access to information on creating a successful PAR program. Next, you should try to recruit volunteers (neighbors, community gardeners, garden clubs, garden centers, and nurseries) to be a part of the program. It is important to establish a local coordinator who can be a “go-to” person for any questions volunteers may have about the program, growing tips, and drop-off sites.</p>

  <p class="indent">In addition to gathering volunteers, it is essential to find a food distribution agency partner who wants to collect the donated produce. This may be a food bank, food pantry, soup kitchen, or local shelter. It is also wise to find someone to market and publicize your local program. Getting the word out about the program will help gather support and more gardeners who want to help. There should also be someone appointed to help coordinate and oversee the drop-off sites and to take food to the designated area if need be.</p>

  <p class="indent">For a PAR program to be a success, it is a good idea to reach out to your local extension services; community, church, and school gardens; businesses; and local food agencies to see if a specific PAR garden can be established. It is also wise to ask farmers to donate their unsold produce from farmers’ markets and trucks in the area. All of these various elements will help you to create a successful fresh food donation program in your area and will ensure that those who are hungry in your community will not be lacking in fresh produce in their diets.</p>

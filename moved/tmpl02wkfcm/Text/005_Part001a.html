  <p class="noindent"><span class="dcap">G</span>rains are a type of grass and they grow almost as easily as the grass in your yard does. There are many reasons for growing your own grains, including supplying feed for your livestock, providing food for you and your family, or to use as a green manure (a crop that will be plowed back into the soil to enrich it). Growing grains requires much less work than growing a vegetable garden, though getting the grains from the field to the table requires a bit more work.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/55-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">Whether you are growing wheat, oats, barley, or another grain, the process is basically the same:</p>

  <p class="nlist1">1. Decide which grain to grow. Most cereal grains have a spring variety and a winter variety. Winter grains are often preferred because they are more nutritious than spring varieties and are less affected by weeds in the spring. However, spring wheat is preferred in cold climates as winter wheat may not survive very harsh winters. If you have trouble finding smaller amounts of seeds to purchase from seed supply houses, try health food stores. They often have bins full of grains you can buy in bulk for eating, and they work just as well for planting, as long as you know what variety of grain you’re buying. Winter grains should be planted from late September to mid-October, after most insects have disappeared but before the hard frosts set in. Spring wheat should be planted in early spring.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Decide how much grain you want to grow. A 10-foot by 10-foot plot of wheat will provide enough flour for about twenty loaves of bread. An acre of corn will provide feed for a pig, a milk cow, a beef steer, and thirty laying hens for an entire year.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. Prepare the soil. Rototill or use a shovel to turn over the earth, remove any stones or weeds, and make the plot as even as possible using a garden rake.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Sprinkle the seeds over the entire plot. How much seed you use will depend on the grain (refer to the chart on <a href="../Text/005_Part001a.html#page_57">page 57</a>). For wheat, use a ratio of around 3 ounces of seed per 100 square feet. Aim to plant about one seed per square inch. Rake over the plot to cover all the seeds with earth.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5. Water the seeds immediately after planting and then about once a month throughout the growing season if there’s not adequate rainfall.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6. When the grain is golden with a few streaks of green left, it’s ready for harvest. For winter grains, harvest is usually ready in June or July. To cut the grains, use a scythe, machete, or other sharp knife, and cut near the base of the stems. Gather the grains into bundles, tie them with twine, and stand them upright in the plot to finish ripening. Lean three or four bundles together to keep them from falling over. If there is danger of rain, move the sheaves into a barn or other covered area to prevent them from molding. Once all the green has turned to gold, the grains are ready for threshing.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/55-3.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="bold">An antique thresher.</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">7. The simplest way to thresh is to grasp a bunch of stalks and beat it around the inside of a barrel, heads facing down. The grain will fall right off the stalks. Alternatively, you can lay the stalks down on a hard surface covered by an old sheet and beat the seed heads with a broom or baseball bat. Discard (or compost) the stalks. If there is enough breeze, the chaff will blow away, leaving only the grains. You can also pour the grain and chaff back and forth between two barrels and allow the wind (which can be supplied by a fan if necessary) to blow away the chaff.</p>

  <p class="nlist">8. Store grain in a covered metal trash can or a wooden bin. Be sure it is kept completely dry and that no rodents can get in.</p>

  <div class="box1">
    <p class="box1hd"><span class="bold">HOW MUCH GRAIN SHOULD YOU GROW TO FEED YOUR FAMILY?</span></p>

    <p class="indent">An acre of wheat will supply about 30 bushels of grain, or around 1,800 pounds. The average American consumes about 140 pounds of wheat in a year. The Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA) recommends the following consumption rates:</p>

    <p class="blist1">•   Adult males, pregnant or nursing mothers, active teens ages 14 to 18: 275 lbs./year</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Women, kids ages 7 to 13, seniors: 175 lbs./year</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Children 6 and under: 60 lbs./year</p>

  <p class="h2" id="id13"><a id="page_58"/><span class="bold">Planting Trees for Shade or Shelter</span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="dcap">T</span>rees in your yard can become home to many different types of wildlife. Trees also reduce your cooling costs by providing shade, help clean the air, add beauty and color, provide shelter from the wind and the sun, and add value to your home.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Choosing a Tree</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Choosing a tree should be a well thought-out decision. Tree planting can be a significant investment, both in money and time. Selecting the proper tree for your yard can provide you with years of enjoyment, as well as significantly increasing the value of your property. However, a tree that is inappropriate for your property can be a constant maintenance problem, or even a danger to your and others’ safety. Before you decide to purchase a tree, take advantage of the many references on gardening at local libraries, universities, arboretums, native plant and gardening clubs, and nurseries. Some questions to consider in selecting a tree include:</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">1. What purpose will this tree serve?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Trees can serve numerous landscape functions, including beautification, screening of sights and sounds, shade and energy conservation, and wildlife habitat.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/58-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">2. Is the species appropriate for your area?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Reliable nurseries will not sell plants that are not suitable for your area. However, some mass marketers have trees and shrubs that are not fitted for the environment in which they are sold. Even if a tree is hardy, it may not flower consistently from year to year if the environmental factors are not conducive for it to do so. If you are buying a tree for its spring flowers and fall fruits, consider climate when deciding which species of tree to plant.</p>

  <p class="indent1">Be aware of microclimates. Microclimates are localized areas where weather conditions may vary from the norm. A very sheltered yard may support vegetation not normally adapted to the region. On the other hand, a north-facing slope may be significantly cooler or windier than surrounding areas, and survival of normally adapted plants may be limited.</p>

  <p class="indent">Select trees native to your area. These trees will be more tolerant of local weather and soil conditions, will enhance natural biodiversity in your neighborhood, and be more beneficial to wildlife than many non-native trees. Avoid exotic trees that can invade other areas, crowd out native plants, and harm natural ecosystems.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">3. How big will it get?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">When planting a small tree, it is often difficult to imagine that in twenty years it will most likely be shading your entire yard. Unfortunately, many trees are planted and later removed when the tree grows beyond the dimensions of the property.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">4. What is the average life expectancy of the tree?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Some trees can live for hundreds of years. Others are considered “short-lived” and may live for only twenty or thirty years. Many short-lived trees tend to be smaller, ornamental species. Short-lived species should not necessarily be ruled out when considering plantings, as they may have other desirable characteristics, such as size, shape, tolerance of shade, or fruit, that would be useful in the landscape. These species may also fill a void in a young landscape, and can be removed as other larger, longer-lived species mature.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">5. Does it have any particular ornamental value, such as leaf color or flowers and fruits?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Some species provide beautiful displays of color for short periods in the spring or fall. Other species may have foliage that is reddish or variegated and can add color in your yard year round. Trees bearing fruits or nuts can provide an excellent source of food for many species of wildlife.</p>

  <p class="img"><a id="page_59"/><img alt="image" src="../Images/59-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">6. Does it have any particular insect, disease, or other problem that may reduce its usefulness in the future?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Certain insects and diseases can cause serious problems for some desirable species in certain regions. Depending on the pest, control of the problem may be difficult and the pest may significantly reduce the attractiveness, if not the life expectancy, of the tree. Other species, such as the silver maple, are known to have weak wood that is susceptible to damage in ice storms or heavy winds. All these factors should be kept in mind, as controlling pests or dealing with tree limbs that have snapped in foul weather can be expensive and potentially damaging.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">7. How common is this species in your neighborhood or town?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Some species are over-planted. Increasing the natural diversity in your area will provide habitat for wildlife and help limit the opportunity for a single pest to destroy large numbers of trees.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">8. Is the tree evergreen or deciduous?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Evergreen trees will provide cover and shade year round. They may also be more effective as wind and noise barriers. On the other hand, deciduous trees will give you summer shade but allow the winter sun to shine in. If planting a deciduous tree, keep these heating and cooling factors in mind when placing the tree in your yard.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Placement of Trees</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Proper placement of trees is critical for your enjoyment and for their long-term survival. Check with local authorities about regulations pertaining to placement of trees in your area. Some communities have ordinances restricting placement of trees within a specified distance from a street, sidewalk, streetlight, or other city utilities.</p>

  <p class="indent">Before planting your tree, consider the tree’s potential maximum size. Ask yourself these simple questions:</p>

  <p class="nlist1">1. When the tree nears maturity, will it be too close to your or a neighbor’s house? An evergreen tree planted on your north side may block the winter sun from your next-door neighbor.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Will it provide too much shade for your vegetable and flower gardens? Most vegetables and many flowers require considerable amounts of sun. If you intend to grow these plants in your yard, consider how the placement of trees will affect these gardens.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. Will the tree obstruct any driveways or sidewalks?</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Will it cause problems for buried or overhead power lines and utility pipes?</p>

  <p class="indent1">Once you have taken these questions into consideration and have bought the perfect tree for your yard, it is time to start digging!</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Planting a Tree</span></p>

  <p class="indent">A properly planted and maintained tree will grow faster and live longer than one that is incorrectly planted. Trees can be planted almost any time of the year, as long as the ground is not frozen. Late summer or early fall is the optimum time to plant trees in many areas. By planting during these times, the tree has a chance to establish new roots before winter arrives and the ground freezes. When spring comes, the tree is then ready to grow. Another feasible time for planting trees is late winter or early spring. Planting in hot summer weather should be avoided if possible as the heat may cause the young tree to wilt. Planting in frozen soil during the winter is very difficult, and is tough on tree roots. When the tree is dormant and the ground is frozen, there is no opportunity for the new roots to begin growing.</p>

  <div class="box1">
    <p class="box1hd"><span class="bold">THINGS YOU’LL NEED</span></p>

    <p class="blist">•   Tree</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Shovel</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Watering can or garden hose</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Measuring stick</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Mulch</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Optional: scissors or knife to cut the burlap or container, stakes, and supporting wires</p>
  </div>

  <p class="indent">Trees can be purchased as container-grown, balled and burlapped (B&amp;B), or bare root. Generally, container-grown are the easiest to plant and to successfully establish in any season, including summer. With container-grown stock, the plant has been growing in a container for a period of time. When planting container-grown trees, little damage is done to the roots as the plant is transferred to the soil. Container-grown trees range in size from very small plants in gallon pots up to large trees in huge pots.</p>

  <p class="indent">B&amp;B trees are dug from a nursery, wrapped in burlap, and kept in the nursery for an additional period of time, giving the roots opportunity to regenerate. B&amp;B plants can be quite large.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bare root trees are usually extremely small plants. Because there is no soil around the roots, they must be planted when they are dormant to avoid drying out, and the roots must be kept moist until planted. Frequently, bare root trees are offered by seed and nursery mail order catalogs, or in the wholesale trade. Many state-operated nurseries and local conservation districts also sell bare root stock in bulk quantities for only a few cents per plant. Bare root plants are usually offered in the early spring and should be planted as soon as possible.</p>

  <p class="indent">Be sure to carefully follow the planting instructions that come with your tree. If specific instructions are not available, here are some general tree-planting guidelines:</p>

  <p class="nlist1">1. Before starting any digging, call your local utility companies to identify the location of any underground wires or lines. In the United States, you can call 811 to have your utility lines marked for free.</p>

  <p class="nlist"><a id="page_60"/>2. Dig a hole twice as wide as, and slightly shallower than, the root ball. Roughen the sides and bottom of the hole with a pick or shovel so that the roots can easily penetrate the soil.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. With a potted tree, gently remove the tree from the container. To do this, lay the tree on its side with the container end near the planting hole. Hit the bottom and sides of the container until the root ball is loosened. If roots are growing in a circular pattern around the root ball, slice through the roots on a couple of sides of the root ball. With trees wrapped in burlap, remove the string or wire that holds the burlap to the root crown; it is not necessary to remove the burlap completely. Plastic wraps must be completely removed. Gently separate circling roots on the root ball. Shorten exceptionally long roots and guide the shortened roots downward and outward. Root tips die quickly when exposed to light and air, so complete this step as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Place the root ball in the hole. Leave the top of the root ball (where the roots end and the trunk begins) ½ to 1 inch above the surrounding soil, making sure not to cover it unless the roots are exposed. For bare root plants, make a mound of soil in the middle of the hole and spread plant roots out evenly over the mound. Do not set the tree too deep into the hole.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5. As you add soil to fill in around the tree, lightly tap the soil to collapse air pockets, or add water to help settle the soil. Form a temporary water basin around the base of the tree to encourage water penetration, and be sure to water the tree thoroughly after planting. A tree with a dry root ball cannot absorb water; if the root ball is extremely dry, allow water to trickle into the soil by placing the hose at the trunk of the tree.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6. Place mulch around the tree. A circle of mulch, 3 feet in diameter, is common.</p>

  <p class="nlist">7. Depending on the size of the tree and the site conditions, staking the tree in place may be beneficial. Staking supports the tree until the roots are well established to properly anchor it. Staking should allow for some movement of the tree on windy days. After trees are established, remove all supporting wires. If these are not removed, they can girdle the tree, cut into the trunk, and eventually kill the tree.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Maintenance</span></p>

  <p class="indent">For the first year or two, especially after a week or so of especially hot or dry weather, watch your tree closely for signs of moisture stress. If you see any leaf wilting or hard, caked soil, water the tree well and slowly enough to allow the water to soak in. This will encourage deep root growth. Keep the area under the tree mulched.</p>

  <p class="indent">Some species of evergreen trees may need protection against winter sun and wind. A thorough watering in the fall before the ground freezes is recommended.</p>

  <p class="indent">Fertilization is usually not needed for newly planted trees. Depending on the soil and growing conditions, fertilizer may be beneficial at a later time.</p>

  <p class="indent">Young trees need protection against rodents, frost cracks, sunscald, lawn mowers, and weed whackers. In the winter months, mice and rabbits frequently girdle small trees by chewing away the bark at the snow level. Since the tissues that transport nutrients in the tree are located just under the bark, a girdled tree often dies in the spring when growth resumes. Weed whackers are also a common cause of girdling. In order to prevent girdling from occurring, use plastic guards, which are inexpensive and easy to control.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/60-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="img"><a id="page_61"/><img alt="image" src="../Images/61-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">Frost cracking is caused by the sunny side of the tree expanding at a different rate than the colder, shaded side. This can cause large splits in the trunk. To prevent this, wrap young trees with paper tree wrap, starting from the base and wrapping up to the bottom branches. Sunscald can occur when a young tree is suddenly moved from a shady spot into direct sunlight. Light-colored tree wraps can be used to protect the trunk from sunscald.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Pruning</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Usually, pruning is not needed on newly planted trees. As the tree grows, lower branches may be pruned to provide clearance above the ground, or to remove dead or damaged limbs or suckers that sprout from the trunk. Sometimes larger trees need pruning to allow more light to enter the canopy. Small branches can be removed easily with pruners. Large branches should be removed with a pruning saw. All cuts should be vertical. This will allow the tree to heal quickly without the use of any artificial sealants. Major pruning should be done in late winter or early spring. At this time, the tree is more likely to “bleed,” as sap is rising through the plant. This is actually healthy and will help prevent invasion by many disease-carrying organisms.</p>

  <p class="indent">Under no circumstance should trees be topped (topping is chopping off large top tree branches). Not only does this practice ruin the natural shape of the tree, but it increases its susceptibility to diseases and results in very narrow crotch angles (the angle between the trunk and the side branch). Narrow crotch angles are weaker than wide ones and more susceptible to damage from wind and ice. If a large tree requires major reduction in height or size, contact a professionally trained arborist.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Final Thoughts</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Trees are natural windbreaks, slowing the wind and providing shelter and food for wildlife. Trees can help protect livestock, gardens, and larger crops. They also help prevent dust particles from adding to smog over urban areas. Tree plantings are key components of an effective conservation system and can provide your yard with beauty, shade, and rich natural resources.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="id14"><a id="page_62"/><span class="bold">Container Gardening</span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="dcap">A</span>n alternative to growing vegetables, flowers, and herbs in a traditional garden is to grow them in containers. While the amount that can be grown in a container is certainly limited, container gardens works well for tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, herbs, salad greens, and many flowering annuals. Choose vegetable varieties that have been specifically bred for container growing. You can obtain this information online or at your garden center. Container gardening also brings birds and butterflies right to your doorstep. Hanging baskets of fuchsia or pots of snapdragons are frequently visited by hummingbirds, allowing for up-close observation.</p>

  <p class="indent">Container gardening is an excellent method of growing vegetables, herbs, and flowers, especially if you do not have adequate outdoor space for a full garden bed. A container garden can be placed anywhere—on the patio, balcony, rooftop, or windowsill. Vegetables such as leaf lettuce, radishes, small tomatoes, and baby carrots can all be grown successfully in pots.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">How to Grow Vegetables in a Container Garden</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Here are some simple steps to follow for growing vegetables in containers:</p>

  <p class="nlist1">1. Choose a sunny area for your container plants. Your plants will need at least five to six hours of sunlight a day. Some plants, such as cucumbers, may need more. Select plants that are suitable for container growing. Usually their names will contain words such as “patio,” “bush,” “dwarf,” “toy,” or “miniature.” Peppers, onions, and carrots are also good choices.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Choose a planter that is at least five gallons, unless the plant is very small. Poke holes in the bottom if they don’t already exist; the soil must be able to drain in order to prevent the roots from rotting. Avoid terracotta or dark colored pots as they tend to dry out quickly.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/62-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/62-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="img"><a id="page_63"/><img alt="image" src="../Images/63-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="nlist">3. Fill your container with potting soil. Good potting soil will have a mixture of peat moss and vermiculite. You can make your own potting soil using composted soil. Read the directions on the seed packet or label to determine how deep to plant your seeds.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Check the moisture of the soil frequently. You don’t want the soil to become muddy, but the soil should always feel damp to the touch. Do not wait until the plant is wilting to water it—at that point, it may be too late.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Things to Consider</span></p>

  <p class="blist">•   Follow normal planting schedules for your climate when determining when to plant your container garden.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   You may wish to line your container with porous materials such as shredded newspaper or rags to keep the soil from washing out. Be sure the water can still drain easily.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">How to Grow Herbs in a Container</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Herbs will thrive in containers if cared for properly. And if you keep them near your kitchen, you can easily snip off pieces to use in cooking. Here’s how to start your own herb container garden:</p>

  <p class="nlist1">1. If your container doesn’t already have holes in the bottom, poke several to allow the soil to drain. Pour gravel into the container until it is about a quarter of the way full. This will help the water drain and help to keep the soil from washing out.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Fill your container three-quarters of the way with potting soil or a soil-based compost.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/63-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="nlist">3. It’s best to use seedlings when planting herbs in containers. Tease the roots slightly, gently spreading them apart with your fingertips. This will encourage them to spread once planted. Place each herb into the pot and cover the root base with soil. Place herbs that will grow taller in the center of your container, and the smaller ones around the edges. Leave about 4 square inches of space between each seedling.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. As you gently press in soil between the plants, leave an inch or so between the container’s top and the soil. You don’t want the container to overflow when you water the herbs.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5. Cut the tops off the taller herb plants to encourage them to grow faster and to produce more leaves.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6. Pour water into the container until it begins to leak out the bottom. Most herbs like to dry out between watering, and over-watering can cause some herbs to rot and die, so only water every few days unless the plants are in a very hot place.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Things to Consider</span></p>

  <p class="blist">•   Growing several kinds of herbs together helps the plants to thrive. A few exceptions to this rule are oregano, lemon balm, and tea balm. These herbs should be planted on their own because they will overtake the other herbs in your container.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   You may wish to choose your herbs according to color to create attractive arrangements for your home. Any of the following herbs will grow well in containers:</p>

  <p class="blista"><a id="page_64"/>•   Silver herbs: artemisias, curry plants, santolinas</p>

  <p class="blista">•   Golden herbs: lemon thyme, calendula, nasturtium, sage, lemon balm</p>

  <p class="blista">•   Blue herbs: borage, hyssop, rosemary, catnip</p>

  <p class="blista">•   Green herbs: basil, mint, marjoram, thyme, parsley, chives, tarragon</p>

  <p class="blista">•   Pink and purple herbs: oregano (the flowers are pink), lavender</p>

  <p class="blist">•   If you decide to transplant your herbs in the summer months, they will grow quite well outdoors and will give you a larger harvest.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">How to Grow Flowers from Seeds in a Container</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1. Cover the drainage hole in the bottom of the pot with a flat stone. This will keep the soil from trickling out when the plant is watered.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Fill the container with soil. The container should be filled almost to the top. For the best results, use potting soil from your local nursery or garden center.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/64-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="nlist">3. Make holes for the seeds. Refer to the seed packet to see how deep to make the holes. Always save the seed packet for future reference—it most likely has helpful directions about thinning young plants.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Place a seed in each hole. Pat the soil gently on top of each seed.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5. Use a light mist to water your seeds, making sure that the soil is only moist and not soaked.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6. Make sure your seeds get the correct amount of sunlight. Refer to the seed packet for the adequate amount of sunlight each seedling needs.</p>

  <p class="nlist">7. Watch your seeds grow. Most seeds take three to seventeen days to sprout. Once the plants start sprouting, be sure to pull out plants that are too close together so the remaining plants will have enough space to establish good root systems.</p>

  <p class="nlist">8. Remember to water and feed your container plants. Keep the soil moist so your plants can grow. And in no time at all, you should have wonderful flowers growing in your container garden.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Preserving Your Container Plants</span></p>

  <p class="indent">As fall approaches, frost will soon descend on your container plants and can ultimately destroy your garden. Container plants are particularly susceptible to frost damage, especially if you are growing tropical plants, perennials, and hardy woody plants in a single container garden. There are many ways that you can preserve and maintain your container garden plants throughout the winter season.</p>

  <p class="indent">Preservation techniques will vary depending on the plants in your container garden. Tropical plants can be over-wintered using methods replicating a dry season, forcing the plant into dormancy; hardy perennials and woody shrubs need a cold dormancy to grow in the spring, so they must stay outside; cacti and succulents prefer their winters warm and dry and must be brought inside, while many annuals can be propagated by stem cuttings or can just be repotted and maintained inside.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Preserving Tropical Bulbs and Tubers</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Many tropical plants, such as cannas, elephant ears, and angel’s trumpets can be saved from an untimely death by over-wintering them in a dark corner or sunny window of your home, depending on the type of plant. A lot of bulbous and tuberous tropical plants have a natural dry season (analogous to our winter) when their leafy parts die off, leaving the bulb behind. Don’t throw the bulbs away. After heavy frosts turn the aboveground plant parts to mush, cut the damaged foliage off about 4 inches above the thickened bulb. Then, dig them up and remove all excess soil from the roots. If a bulb has been planted for several years and it’s performance is beginning to decline, it may need dividing. Daffodil’s, for example, should generally be divided every three years. If you do divide the bulb, be sure to dust all cut surfaces with a sulfur-based fungicide made for bulbs to prevent the wounds from rotting. Cut the roots back to 1 inch from the bulb and leave to dry out evenly. Rotten bulbs or roots need to be thrown away so infection doesn’t spread to the healthy bulbs.</p>

  <p class="indent">A bulb’s or tuber’s drying time can last up to two weeks if it is sitting on something absorbent like newspaper and located somewhere shaded and dry, such as a garage or basement. Once clean and dry, bulbs should be stored—preferably at around 50°F—all winter in damp (not soggy) milled peat moss. This prevents the bulbs from drying out any further, which could cause them to die. Many gardeners don’t have a perfectly cool basement or garage to keep bulbs dormant. Alternative methods for dry storage include a dark closet with the door cracked for circulation, a cabinet, or underneath a bed in a cardboard box with a few holes punched for airflow. The important thing to keep in mind is that the bulb needs to be kept on the dry side, in the dark, and moderately warm.</p>

  <p class="img"><a id="page_65"/><img alt="image" src="../Images/65-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">If a bulb was grown as a single specimen in its own pot, the entire pot can be placed in a garage that stays above 50°F or a cool basement and allowed to dry out completely. Cut all aboveground plant parts flush with the soil and don’t water until the outside temperatures stabilize above 60°F. Often, bulbs break dormancy unexpectedly in this dry pot method. If this happens, pots can be moved to a sunny location near a window and watered sparingly until they can be placed outside. The emerging leaves will be stunted, but once outside, the plant will replace any spindly leaves with lush, new ones.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Annuals</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Many herbaceous annuals can also be saved for the following year. By rooting stem cuttings in water on a sunny windowsill, plants like impatiens, coleus, sweet potato vine cultivars, and purple heart can be held over winter until needed in the spring. Otherwise, the plants can be cut back by half, potted in a peat-based, soilless mix, and placed on a sunny windowsill. With a wide assortment of “annuals” available on the market, some research is required to determine which annuals can be over-wintered successfully. True annuals (such as basils, cockscomb, and zinnias)—regardless of any treatment given—will go to seed and die when brought inside.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Cacti and Succulents</span></p>

  <p class="indent">If you planted a mixed dry container this year and want to retain any of the plants for next year, they should be removed from the main container and repotted into a high-sand-content soil mix for cacti and succulents. Keep them in a sunny window and water when dry. Many succulents and cacti do well indoors, either in a heated garage or a moderately sunny corner of a living room.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/65-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_66"/>As with other tropical plants, succulents also need time to adjust to sunnier conditions in the spring. Move them to a shady spot outside when temperatures have stabilized above 60°F and then gradually introduce them to brighter conditions.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Hardy Perennials, Shrubs, and Vines</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Hardy perennials, woody shrubs, and vines needn’t be thrown away when it’s time to get rid of accent containers. Crack-resistant, four-season containers can house perennials and woody shrubs year-round. Below is a list of specific perennials and woody plants that do well in both hot and cold weather, indoors and out:</p>

  <p class="blist1">•   Shade perennials, like coral bells, lenten rose, assorted hardy ferns, and Japanese forest grass are great for all weather containers.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   Sun-loving perennials, such as sedges, some salvias, purple coneflower, daylily, spiderwort, and bee blossom are also very hardy and do well in year-round containers. Interplant them with cool growing plants, like kale, pansies, and Swiss chard, for fall and spring interest.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   Woody shrubs and vines—many of which have great foliage interest with four-season appeal—are ideal for container gardens. Red-twigged dogwood cultivars, clematis vine cultivars, and dwarf crape myrtle cultivars are great container additions that can stay outdoors year-round.</p>

  <p class="indent">If the container has to be removed, hardy perennials and woody shrubs can be temporarily planted in the ground and mulched. Dig them from the garden in the spring, if you wish, and replant into a container. Or, leave them in their garden spot and start over with fresh ideas and new plant material for your container garden.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/66-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="bold">If your floor space is limited, a ladder can provide additional surface area on which to keep your potted plants.</span></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Sustainable Plants and Money in Your Pocket</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Over-wintering is a great form of sustainable plant conservation achieved simply and effectively by adhering to each plant’s cultural and environmental needs. With careful planning and storage techniques, you’ll save money as well as plant material. The beauty and interest you’ve created in this season’s well-grown container garden can also provide enjoyment for years to come.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="id15"><a id="page_67"/><span class="bold">Rooftop Gardens</span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="dcap">I</span>f you live in an urban area and don’t have a lawn, that does not mean that you cannot have a garden. Whether you live in an apartment building or you’re a homeowner without yard space, you can grow your very own garden, right on your roof!</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Is Your Roof Suitable for a Rooftop Garden?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Theoretically, any roof surface can be greened—even sloped or curved roofs can support a layer of sod or wildflowers. However, if the angle of your roof is over 30 degrees you should consult with a specialist. Very slanted roofs make it difficult to keep the soil in place until the plants’ roots take hold. Certainly, a flat roof, approximating level ground conditions, is the easiest on which to grow a garden, though a slight slant can be helpful in allowing drainage.</p>

  <p class="indent">Also consider how much weight your roof can bear. A simple, lightweight rooftop garden will weigh between 13 and 30 pounds per square foot. Add to this your own weight—or that of anyone who will be tending or enjoying the garden—gardening tools, and, if you live in a colder climate, the additional weight of snow in the winter.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Will a Rooftop Garden Cause Water Leakage or Other Damage?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">No. In fact, planting beds or surfaces are often used to protect and insulate roofs. However, you should take some precautions to protect your roof:</p>

  <p class="nlist1">1. Cover your roof with a layer of waterproof material, such as a heavy-duty pond liner. You may want to place an old rug on top of the waterproof material to help it stay in place and to give additional support to the materials on top.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Place a protective drainage layer on top of the waterproof material. Otherwise, shovels, shoe heels, or dropped tools could puncture the roof. Use a coarse material such as gravel, pumice, or expanded shale.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. Place a filter layer on top of the drainage layer to keep soil in place so that it won’t clog up your drainage. A lightweight polyester geotextile (an inexpensive, non-woven fabric found at most home improvement stores) is ideal for this. Note that if your roof has an angle greater than 10 degrees, only install the filter layer around the edges of the roof as it can increase slippage.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Using moveable planters or containers, modular walkways and surfacing treatment, and compartmentalized planting beds will make it easier to fix leaks should they appear.</p>

  <div class="box1">

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">How to Make a Rooftop Garden</span></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Preparation</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1. Before you begin, find out if it is possible and legal to create a garden on your roof. You don’t want to spend lots of time and money preparing for a garden and then find out that it is prohibited.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Make sure that the roof is able to hold the weight of a rooftop garden. If so, figure out how much weight it can hold. Remember this when making the garden and use lighter containers and soil as needed.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Setting Up the Garden</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1. Install your waterproof, protective drainage, and filter layers, as described above. If your roof is angled, you may want to place a wooden frame around the edges of the roof to keep the layers from sliding off. Be sure to use rot-resistant wood and cut outlets into the frame to allow excess water to drain away. Layer pebbles around the outlets to aid drainage and to keep vegetation from clogging them.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Add soil to your garden. It should be 1 to 4 inches thick and will be best if it’s a mix of three-fourths inorganic soil (crushed brick or a similar granular material) and one-fourth organic compost.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/67-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><a id="page_68"/><span class="bold">Planting and Maintaining the Garden</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1. Start planting. You can plant seeds or seedlings, or transplant mature plants. Choose plants that are wind-resistant and won’t need a great deal of maintenance. Sedums make excellent rooftop plants as they require very little attention once planted, are hardy, and are attractive throughout most of the year. Most vegetables can be grown in-season on rooftops, though the wind will make taller vegetables (like corn or beans) difficult to grow. If your roof is slanted, plant drought-resistant plant varieties near the peak, as they’ll get less water.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Water your garden immediately after planting, and then regularly throughout the growing season, unless rain does the work for you.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Things to Consider</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1. If you live in a very hot area, you may want to build small wooden platforms to elevate your plants above the hot rooftop. This will help increase the ventilation around the plants.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. When determining whether or not your roof is strong enough to support a garden, remember that large pots full of water and soil will be very heavy, and if the roof is not strong enough, your garden could cause structural damage.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. You can use pots or other containers on your rooftop rather than making a full garden bed. You should still first find out how much weight your roof can hold and choose lightweight containers.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Consider adding a fence or railing around your roof, especially if children will be helping in the garden.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/68-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="bold">In many cases, potted plants make more sense than laying a garden bed when it comes to green roofs.</span></p>

  <p class="h2" id="id16"><a id="page_69"/><span class="bold">Raised Beds</span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="dcap">I</span>f you live in an area where the soil is quite wet (preventing a good vegetable garden from growing the spring), or find it difficult to bend over to plant and cultivate your vegetables or flowers, or if you just want a different look to your backyard garden, you should consider building a raised bed.</p>

  <p class="indent">A raised bed is an interesting and affordable way to garden. It creates an ideal environment for growing vegetables, since the soil concentration can be closely monitored and, as it is raised above the ground, it reduces the compaction of plants from people walking on the soil.</p>

  <p class="indent">Raised beds are typically 2 to 6 feet wide and as long as needed. In most cases, a raised bed consists of a “frame” that is filled in with nutrient-rich soil (including compost or organic fertilizers) and is then planted with a variety of vegetables or flowers, depending on the gardener’s preference. By controlling the bed’s construction and the soil mixture that goes into the bed, a gardener can effectively reduce the amount of weeds that will grow in the garden.</p>

  <p class="indent">When planting seeds or young sprouts in a raised bed, it is best to space the plants equally from each other on all sides. This will ensure that the leaves will be touching once the plant is mature, thus saving space and reducing the soil’s moisture loss.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/69-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">How to Make a Raised Bed</span></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Step One: Plan Out Your Raised Bed</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1. Think about how you’d like your raised bed to look, and then design the shape. A raised bed is not extremely complicated, and all you need to do is build an open-top and open-bottom box (if you are ambitious, you can create a raised bed in the shape of a circle, hexagon, or star). The main purpose of this box is to hold soil.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Make a drawing of your raised bed, measure your available garden space, and add those measurements to your drawing. This will allow you to determine how much material is needed. Generally, your bed should be at least 24 inches in height.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. Decide what kind of material you want to use for your raised bed. You can use lumber, plastic, synthetic wood, railroad ties, bricks, rocks, or a number of other items to hold the dirt. Using lumber is the easiest and most efficient method.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Gather your supplies.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Step Two: Build Your Raised Bed</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1. Make sure your bed will be situated in a place that gets plenty of sunlight. Carefully assess your placement, as your raised bed will be fairly permanent.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Connect the sides of your bed together (with either screws or nails) to form the desired shape of your bed. If you are using lumber, you can use 4-inch x 4-inch posts to serve as the corners of your bed, and then nail or screw the sides to these corner posts. By doing so, you will increase strength of the structure and ensure that the dirt will stay inside.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. Cut a piece of gardening plastic to fit inside your raised bed. This will significantly reduce the amount of weeds growing in your garden. Lay it out in the appropriate location.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Place your frame over the gardening plastic (this might take two people).</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Step Three: Start Planting</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1. Add some compost into the bottom of the bed and then layer potting soil on top of the compost. If you have soil from other parts of your yard, feel free to use that in addition to the compost and potting soil. Plan on filling at least one-third of your raised bed with compost or composted manure (available from nurseries or garden centers in 40-pound bags).</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/69-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="img"><a id="page_70"/><img alt="image" src="../Images/70-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Mix in dry organic fertilizers (like wood ash, bone meal, and blood meal) while building your bed. Follow the package instructions for how best to mix it in.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. Decide what you want to plant. Some people like to grow flowers in their raised beds; others prefer to grow vegetables. If you do want to grow food, raised beds are excellent choices for salad greens, carrots, onions, radishes, beets, and other root crops.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Things to Consider</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1. To save money, you can dig up and use soil from your yard. Potting soil can be expensive, and yard soil is just as effective when mixed with compost. However, removing grass and weeds from the soil before filling your raised beds can be time-consuming.</p>

  <div class="box1">
    <p class="box1hd"><span class="bold">THINGS YOU’LL NEED</span></p>

    <p class="blist">•   Forms for your raised bed (consider using 4-inch x 4-inch posts cut to 24 inches in height for corners, and 2-inch x 12-inch boards for the sides)</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Nails or screws</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Hammer or screwdriver</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Plastic liner (to act as a weed barrier at the bottom of your bed)</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Shovel</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Compost or composted manure</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Soil (either potting soil or soil from another part of your yard)</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Rake (to smooth out the soil once in the bed)</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Seeds or young plants</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Optional: PVC piping and greenhouse plastic (to convert your raised bed to a greenhouse)</p>
  </div>

  <p class="nlist">2. Be creative when building your raised planting bed. You can construct a great raised bed out of recycled goods or old lumber.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. You can convert your raised bed into a greenhouse. Just add hoops to your bed by bending and connecting PVC pipe over the bed. Then clip greenhouse plastic to the PVC pipes, and you have your own greenhouse.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Make sure to water your raised bed often. Because it is above ground, your raised bed will not retain water as well as the soil in the ground. If you keep your bed narrow, it will help conserve water.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5. Decorate or illuminate your raised bed to make it a focal point in your yard.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6. If you use lumber to construct your raised bed, keep a watch out for termites.</p>

  <p class="nlist">7. Beware of old pressure-treated lumber, as it may contain arsenic and could potentially leak into the root systems of any vegetables you might grow in your raised bed. Newer pressure-treated lumber should not contain these toxic chemicals.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="id17"><a id="page_71"/><span class="bold">Growing Plants Without Soil</span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="dcap">H</span>ydroponics is the method of growing plants in a container filled with a nutrient-rich bath (water with special fertilizer) and no soil. Plants grown in soilless cultures still need the basic requirements of plant growth, such as temperature, light (if indoors, use a heat-lamp and set the container near or on a windowsill), water, oxygen (you can produce good airflow by using a small, rotating fan indoors), carbon dioxide, and mineral nutrients (derived from solutions). But instead of planting their roots in soil, hydroponically grown plants have their roots either free-floating in a nutrient-rich solution or bedded in a soil-like medium, such as sand, gravel, brick shards, Perlite, or rockwool. These plants do not have to exert as much energy to gather nutrients from the soil and thus they grow more quickly and, usually, more productively.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">The Benefits and Drawbacks of Growing Plants in a Hydroponics System</span></p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Benefits:</span></p>

  <p class="blist">•   Plants can be grown in areas where normal plant agriculture is difficult (such as deserts and other arid places, or cities).</p>

  <p class="blist">•   Most terrestrial plants will grow in a hydroponics system.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/71-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/71-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="blist">•   There is minimal weed growth.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   The system takes up less space than a soil system.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   It conserves water.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   No fear of contaminated runoff from garden fertilizers.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   There is less labor and cost involved.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   Certain seasonal plants can be raised during any season.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   The quality of produce is generally consistent.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   Old nutrient solution can be used to water houseplants.</p>

  <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Drawbacks:</span></p>

  <p class="blist">•   Can cause salmonella to grow due to the wet and confined conditions.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   More difficult to grow root vegetables, such as carrots and potatoes.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   If nutrient solution is not regularly changed, plants can become nutrient deficient and thus not grow or produce.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Types of Hydroponics Systems</span></p>

  <p class="indent">There are two main types of soilless cultures that can be used in order to grow plants and vegetables. The first is a water culture, in which plants are supplied with mineral nutrients directly from the water solution. The second, called aggregate culture or “sand culture,” uses an aggregate (such as sand, gravel, or Perlite) as soil to provide an anchoring support for the plant roots. Both types of hydroponics are effective in growing soilless plants and in providing essential nutrients for healthy and productive plant growth.</p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_72"/><span class="bold">Water Culture</span></p>

  <p class="indent">The main advantage of using a water culture system is that a significant part of the nutrient solution is always in contact with the plants’ roots. This provides an adequate amount of water and nutrients. The main disadvantages of this system are providing sufficient air supply for the roots and providing the roots with proper support and anchorage.</p>

  <p class="indent">Water culture systems are not extremely expensive, though the cost does depend on the price of the chemicals and water used in the preparation of the nutrient solutions, the size of your container, and whether or not you are using mechanized objects, such as pumps and filters. You can decrease the cost by starting small and using readily available materials.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Materials Needed to Make Your Own Water Culture</span></p>

  <p class="indent">A large water culture system will need either a wood or concrete tank 6 to 18 inches deep and 2 to 3 feet wide. If you use a wooden container, be sure there are no knots in the wood and seal the tank with non-creosote or tar asphalt.</p>

  <p class="indent">For small water culture systems, which are recommended for beginners, glass jars, earthenware crocks, or plastic buckets will suffice as your holding tanks. If your container is transparent, be sure to paint the outside of the container with black paint to keep the light out (and to keep algae from growing inside your system). Keep a narrow vertical strip unpainted in order to see the level of the nutrient solution inside your container.</p>

  <p class="indent">The plant bed should be 3 or more inches deep and large enough to cover the container or tank. In order to support the weight of the litter (where your seeds or seedlings are placed), cover the bottom of the bed with chicken wire and then fill the bed with litter (wood shavings, sphagnum moss, peat, or other organic materials that do not easily decay). If you are starting your plants from seeds, germinate the seeds in a bed of sand and then transplant to the water culture bed, keeping the bed moist until the plants get their roots down into the nutrient solution.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Aeration</span></p>

  <p class="indent">A difficulty in using water culture is keeping the solution properly aerated. It is important to try to keep enough space between the seed bed and the nutrient solution so the plant’s roots can receive proper oxygen. In order to make sure that air can easily flow into the container, either prop up the seed bed slightly to allow air flow or drill a hole in your container just above the highest solution level.</p>

  <p class="indent">In order to make sure there is sufficient oxygen reaching the plant roots, you can install an aquarium pump in your water culture system. Just make sure that the water is not agitated too much or the roots may be damaged. You can also use an air stone or perforated pipe to gently introduce air flow into your container.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/72-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="bold">In a water culture system, the roots are always in contact with the nutrient solution.</span></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Water Supply</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Your hydroponics system needs an adequate supply of fresh water in order to maintain healthy plant life. Make sure that the natural minerals in your water are not going to adversely affect your hydroponics plants. If there is too much sodium in your water (usually an effect of softened water), it could become toxic to your plants. In general, the minerals in water are typically not harmful to the growth of your plants.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Nutrient Solution</span></p>

  <p class="indent">You may add nutrient solution by hand, by a gravity-feed system, or mechanically. In smaller water culture systems, mixing the nutrient solution in a small container and adding it by hand, as needed, is typically adequate.</p>

  <p class="indent">If you are using a larger setup, a gravity-feed system will work quite well. In this type of system, the nutrient solution is mixed in a vat and then tapped from the vat into your container as needed. You can use a plastic container or larger earthenware jar as the vat.</p>

  <p class="indent">A pump can also be used to supply your system with adequate nutrient solution. You can insert the pump into the vat and then transfer the solution to your hydroponics system.</p>

  <p class="indent">When your plants are young, it is important to keep the space between your seed bed and the nutrient solution quite small (that way, the young plant roots can reach the nutrients). As your plants grow, the amount of space between the bed and solution should increase (but do this slowly and keep the level rather consistent).</p>

  <p class="indent">If the temperature is rather high and there is increased evaporation, it is important to keep the roots at the correct level in the water and change the nutrient solution every day, if needed.</p>

  <p class="indent">Drain your container every two weeks and then renew the nutrient solution from your vat or by hand. This must be done in a short amount of time, so the roots do not dry out.</p>

  <p class="h4"><a id="page_73"/><span class="bold">Transplanting</span></p>

  <p class="indent">When transplanting your seedlings, it’s important to make sure that you are careful with the tiny root systems. Gently work the roots through the support netting and down into the nutrient solution. Then fill in the support netting with litter to help the plant remain upright.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">How to Build a Simple, Homemade Hydroponics System</span></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Steps to Building Your Hydroponics System</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1. Find a container to use as a reservoir, such as a fish tank, a bin, or a bucket. The reservoir should be painted black if it is not lightproof (or covered with a thick, black trash bag if you want to reuse the tank at some point), and allowed to dry before moving on to the next step. Allowing light to enter the reservoir will promote the growth of algae. Use a reservoir that is the same dimensions (length and width) from top to bottom.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Using a knife or sharp object, score a line on the tank (scratch off some paint in a straight line from top to bottom). This will be your water level meter, which will allow you to see how much water is in the reservoir and will give you a more accurate and convenient view of the nutrient solution level in your tank.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. Use a tape measure to determine the length and width of your reservoir. Measure the inside of the reservoir from one end to the other. Once you have the dimensions, cut the Styrofoam ¼ inch smaller than the size of the reservoir. For example, if your dimensions are 36 x 20 inches, you should cut the Styrofoam to 35 ¾ x 19 ¾ inches. The Styrofoam should fit nicely in the reservoir, with just enough room to adjust to any water level changes. If the reservoir tapers off at the bottom (the bottom is smaller in dimension than the top) the floater (Styrofoam) should be 2 to 4 inches smaller than the reservoir, or more if necessary.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Do not place the Styrofoam in the reservoir yet. First, you need to cut holes for the net pots. Put the net pots on the Styrofoam where you want to place each plant. Using a pen or pencil, trace around the bottom of each net pot. Use a knife or box cutter to follow the trace lines and cut the holes for pots. On one end of the Styrofoam, cut a small hole for the air line to run into the reservoir.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5. The number of plants you can grow will depend on the size of the garden you build and the types of crops you want to grow. Remember to space plants appropriately so that each receives ample amounts of light.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6. The pump you choose must be strong enough to provide enough oxygen to sustain plant life. Ask for advice choosing a pump at your local hydroponics supply store or garden center.</p>

  <p class="nlist">7. Connect the air line to the pump and attach the air stone to the free end. The air line should be long enough to travel from the pump into the bottom of the reservoir, or at least float in the middle of the tank so the oxygen bubbles can get to the plant roots. It also must be the right size for the pump you choose. Most pumps will come with the correct size air line. To determine the tank’s capacity, use a one-gallon bucket or bottle and fill the reservoir. Remember to count how many gallons it takes to fill the reservoir and you will know the correct capacity of your tank.</p>

    <p class="indent">Encourage middle or high school aged kids to come up with their own hydroponic designs. Encourage them to research different methods and find materials around the house. Hydroponic growing systems make great science fair projects!</p>
  </div>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Setting Up Your Hydroponics System</span></p>

  <p class="nlist">1. Fill the reservoir with the nutrient solution.</p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Place the Styrofoam into the reservoir.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. Run the air line through the designated hole or notch.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Fill the net pots with growing medium and place one plant in each pot.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5. Put the net pots into the designated holes in the Styrofoam.</p>

  <p class="nlist">6. Plug in the pump, turn it on, and start growing with your fully functional, homemade hydroponics system.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Things to Consider</span></p>

  <p class="blist">•   A homemade hydroponics system like this is not ideal for large-scale production of plants or for commercial usage. This particular system does not offer a way to conveniently change the nutrient solution. An extra container would be required to hold the floater while you change the solution.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   Lettuce, watercress, tomatoes, cucumbers, and herbs grow especially well hydroponically.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Aggregate Culture</span></p>

  <p class="indent">This type of hydroponics system utilizes different mediums that act in the place of soil to stabilize the plant and its roots. The aggregate in the container is flooded with the nutrient solution. The advantage of this type of system is that there is not as much trouble with aerating the roots. Also, aggregate culture systems allow for the easy transplantation of seedlings into the aggregate medium and it is less expensive.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Materials Needed for an Aggregate Culture System</span></p>

  <p class="indent">The container should be watertight to help conserve the nutrient solution. Large tanks can be made of concrete or wood, and smaller operations can effectively be done in glass jars, earthenware containers, or plastic buckets. Make sure to paint transparent containers black.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_74"/>Aggregate materials may differ greatly, depending on what type you choose to use. Silica sand (well washed) is one of the best materials that can be used. Any other type of coarse-textured sand is also effective, but make sure it does not contain lime. Sand holds moisture quite well and it allows for easy transplantation. A mixture of sand and gravel together is also an effective aggregate. Other materials, such as peat moss, vermiculite, wood shavings, and coco peat, are also good aggregates. You can find aggregate materials at your local garden center, home center, or garden-supply house.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Aeration</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Aggregate culture systems allow much easier aeration than water culture systems. Draining and refilling the container with nutrient solution helps the air to move in and out of the aggregate material. This brings a fresh supply of oxygen to the plant roots.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Water Supply</span></p>

  <p class="indent">The same water requirements are needed for this type of hydroponics system as for a water culture system. Minerals in the water tend to collect in the aggregate material, so it’s a good idea to flush the material with fresh water every few weeks.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Nutrient Solution</span></p>

  <p class="indent">The simplest way of adding the nutrient solution to aggregate cultures is to pour it over the aggregates by hand. You may also use a manual gravity-feed system with buckets or vats. Attach the vat to the bottom of the container with a flexible hose, raise the vat to flood the container, and lower it to drain it. Cover the vat to prevent evaporation and replenish it with new nutrient solution once every two weeks.</p>

  <p class="indent">A gravity drip-feed system also works well and helps reduce the amount of work you do. Place the vat higher than the container, and then control the solution drip so it is just fast enough to keep the aggregate moist.</p>

  <p class="indent">It is important that the nutrient solution is added and drained or raised and lowered at least once a day. In hotter weather, the aggregate material may need more wetting with the solution. Make sure that the material is not drying out the roots. Drenching the aggregate with solution often will not harm the plants but letting the roots dry out could have detrimental effects.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/74-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="bold">A simple aggregate culture system</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Always replace your nutrient solution after two weeks. Not replacing the solution will cause salts and harmful fertilizer residues to build up, which may ultimately damage your plants.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Planting</span></p>

  <p class="indent">You may use either seedlings or rooted cuttings in an aggregate culture system. The aggregate should be flooded and solution drained before planting to create a moist, compacted seed bed. Seeds may also be planted directly into the aggregate material. Do not plant the seeds too deep, and flood the container frequently with water to keep the aggregate moist. Once the seedlings have germinated, you may start using the nutrient solution.</p>

  <p class="indent">If you are transplanting seedlings from a germination bed, make sure they have germinated in soilless material, as any soil left on the roots may cause them to rot and may hamper them in obtaining nutrients from the solution.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Making Nutrient Solutions</span></p>

  <p class="indent">In order for plants to grow properly, they must receive nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron, manganese, boron, zinc, copper, molybdenum, and chlorine. There are a wide range of nutrient solutions that can be used. If your plants are receiving inadequate amounts of nutrients, they will show this in different ways. This means that you must proceed with caution when selecting and adding the minerals that will be present in your nutrient solution.</p>

  <p class="indent">It is important to have pure nutrient materials when preparing the solution. Using fertilizer-grade chemicals is always the best route to go, as it is cheapest. When housing your nutrient solution, be sure the containers are not transparent (if they are, paint them black to keep out the light). Make sure the containers are closed and not exposed to air. Evaporation from solution concentrates the amount of salt, which could harm your plants.</p>

  <p class="img"><a id="page_75"/><img alt="image" src="../Images/75-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Pre-mixed Chemicals</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Many of the essential nutrients needed for hydroponic plant growth are now available already mixed in their correct proportions. You may find these solutions in catalogs or from garden-supply stores. They are typically inexpensive and only small quantities are needed to help your plants grow strong and healthy. Always follow the directions on the container when using pre-mixed chemicals.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Making Your Own Solution</span></p>

  <p class="indent">In the event that you want to make your own nutrient solution, here is a formula for a solution that will provide all the major elements required for your plants to grow.</p>

  <p class="indent">You can obtain all of these chemicals from garden-supply stores or drugstores.</p>

  <p class="indent">After all the chemicals have been mixed into the solution, check the pH of the solution. A pH of 7.0 is neutral; anything below 7.0 is acidic and anything above is alkaline. Certain plants grow best in certain pHs. Plants that grow well at a lower pH (between 4.5 and 5.5) are azaleas, buttercups, gardenias, and roses; plants that grow well at a neutral pH are potatoes, zinnias, and pumpkins; most plants grow best in a slightly acidic pH (between 5.5 and 6.5).</p>

  <p class="indent">To determine the pH of your solution, use a pH indicator (these are usually paper strips). The strip will change color when placed in different levels of pH. If you find your pH level to be above your desired range, you can bring it down by adding dilute sulfuric acid in small quantities using an eyedropper. Keep retesting until you reach your desired pH level.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Plant Nutrient Deficiencies</span></p>

  <p class="indent">When plants are lacking nutrients, they typically display these deficiencies outwardly. Following is a list of symptoms that might occur if a plant is lacking a certain type of nutrient. If your plants display any of these symptoms, it is imperative that the level of that particular nutrient be increased.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="id18"><a id="page_76"/><span class="bold">Pest and Disease Management</span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="dcap">P</span>est management can be one of the greatest challenges to the home gardener. Yard pests include weeds, insects, diseases, and some species of wildlife. Weeds are plants that are growing out of place. Insect pests include an enormous number of species from tiny thrips that are nearly invisible to the naked eye, to the large larvae of the tomato hornworm. Plant diseases are caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, and other organisms—some of which are only now being classified. Poor plant nutrition and misuse of pesticides also can cause injury to plants. Slugs, mites, and many species of wildlife, such as rabbits, deer, and crows, can be extremely destructive as well.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Identify the Problem</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Careful identification of the problem is essential before taking measures to control the issue in your garden. Some insect damage may at first appear to be a disease, especially if no visible insects are present. Nutrient problems may also mimic diseases. Herbicide damage, resulting from misapplication of chemicals, can also be mistaken for other problems. Learning about different types of garden pest is the first step in keeping your plants healthy and productive.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/76-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="bold">Japanese beetle.</span></p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Insects and Mites</span></p>

  <p class="indent">All insects have six legs, but other than that they are extremely different depending on the species. Some insects include such organisms as beetles, flies, bees, ants, moths, and butterflies. Mites and spiders have eight legs—they are not, in fact, insects but will be treated as such for the purposes of this section.</p>

  <p class="indent">Insects damage plants in several ways. The most visible damage caused by insects is chewed plant leaves and flowers. Many pests are visible and can be readily identified, including the Japanese beetle, Colorado potato beetle, and numerous species of caterpillars such as tent caterpillars and tomato hornworms. Other chewing insects, however, such as cutworms (which are caterpillars) come out at night to eat, and burrow into the soil during the day. These are much harder to identify but should be considered likely culprits if young plants seem to disappear overnight or are found cut off at ground level.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sucking insects are extremely common in gardens and can be very damaging to your vegetable plants and flowers. The most known of these insects are leafhoppers, aphids, mealy bugs, thrips, and mites. These insects insert their mouthparts into the plant tissues and suck out the plant juices. They also may carry diseases that they spread from plant to plant as they move about the yard. You may suspect that these insects are present if you notice misshapen plant leaves or flower petals. Often the younger leaves will appear curled or puckered. Flowers developing from the buds may only partially develop if they’ve been sucked by these bugs. Look on the undersides of the leaves—that is where many insects tend to gather.</p>

  <p class="indent">Other insects cause damage to plants by boring into stems, fruits, and leaves, possibly disrupting the plant’s ability to transport water. They also create opportunities for disease organisms to attack the plants. You may suspect the presence of boring insects if you see small accumulations of sawdust-like material on plant stems or fruits. Common examples of boring insects include squash vine borers and corn borers.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</span></p>

  <p class="indent">It is difficult, if not impossible, to prevent all pest problems in your garden every year. If your best prevention efforts have not been entirely successful, you may need to use some control methods. Integrated pest management (IPM) relies on several techniques to keep pests at acceptable population levels without excessive use of chemical controls. The basic principles of IPM include monitoring (scouting), determining tolerable injury levels (thresholds), and applying appropriate strategies and tactics to solve the pest issue. Unlike other methods of pest control where pesticides are applied on a rigid schedule, IPM applies only those controls that are needed, when they are needed, to control pests that will cause more than a tolerable level of damage to the plant.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Monitoring</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Monitoring is essential for a successful IPM program. Check your plants regularly. Look for signs of damage from insects and diseases as well as indications of adequate fertility and moisture. Early identification of potential problems is essential.</p>

  <p class="indent">There are thousands of insects in a garden, many of which are harmless or even beneficial to the plants. Proper identification is needed before control strategies can be adopted. It is important to recognize the different stages of insect development for several reasons. The caterpillars eating your plants may be the larvae of the butterflies you were trying to attract. Any small larva with six spots on its back is probably a young ladybug, a very beneficial insect.</p>

  <p class="h4"><a id="page_77"/><span class="bold">Thresholds</span></p>

  <p class="indent">It is not necessary to kill every insect, weed, or disease organism invading your garden in order to maintain the plants’ health. When dealing with garden pests, an economic threshold comes into play and is the point where the damage caused by the pest exceeds the cost of control. In a home garden, this can be difficult to determine. What you are growing and how you intend to use it will determine how much damage you are willing to tolerate. Remember that larger plants, especially those close to harvest, can tolerate more damage than a tiny seedling. A few flea beetles on a radish seedling may warrant control, whereas numerous Japanese beetles eating the leaves of beans close to harvest may not.</p>

  <p class="indent">If the threshold level for control has been exceeded, you may need to employ control strategies. Effective and safe strategies can be discussed with your local Cooperative Extension Service, garden centers, or nurseries.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Mechanical/Physical Control Strategies</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Many insects can simply be removed by hand. This method is definitely preferable if only a few, large insects are causing the problem. Simply remove the insect from the plant and drop it into a container of soapy water or vegetable oil. Be aware that some insects have prickly spines or excrete oily substances that can cause injury to humans. Use caution when handling unfamiliar insects. Wear gloves or remove insects with tweezers.</p>

  <p class="indent">Many insects can be removed from plants by spraying water from a hose or sprayer. Small vacuums can also be used to suck up insects. Traps can be used effectively for some insects as well. These come in a variety of styles depending on the insect to be caught. Many traps rely on the use of pheromones—naturally occurring chemicals produced by the insects and used to attract the opposite sex during mating. They are extremely specific for each species and, therefore, will not harm beneficial species. One caution with traps is that they may actually draw more insects into your yard, so don’t place them directly into your garden. Other traps (such as yellow and blue sticky cards) are more generic and will attract numerous species. Different insects are attracted to different colors of these traps. Sticky cards also can be used effectively to monitor insect pests.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Other Pest Controls</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Diatomaceous earth, a powder-like dust made of tiny marine organisms called diatoms, can be used to reduce damage from soft-bodied insects and slugs. Spread this material on the soil—it is sharp and cuts or irritates these soft organisms. It is harmless to other organisms. In order to trap slugs, put out shallow dishes of beer.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/77-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="bold">Worm holes are a common problem for apples not sprayed with pesticides.</span></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Biological Controls</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Biological controls are nature’s way of regulating pest populations. Biological controls rely on predators and parasites to keep organisms under control. Many of our present pest problems result from the loss of predator species and other biological control factors.</p>

  <p class="indent">Some biological controls include birds and bats that eat insects. A single bat can eat up to 600 mosquitoes an hour. Many bird species eat insect pests on trees and in the garden.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Chemical Controls</span></p>

  <p class="indent">When using biological controls, be very careful with pesticides. Most common pesticides are broad spectrum, which means that they kill a wide variety of organisms. Spray applications of insecticides are likely to kill numerous beneficial insects as well as the pests. Herbicides applied to weed species may drift in the wind or vaporize in the heat of the day and injure non-targeted plants. Runoff of pesticides can pollute water. Many pesticides are toxic to humans as well as pets and small animals that may enter your yard. Try to avoid using these types of pesticides at all costs—and if you do use them, read the labels carefully and avoid spraying them on windy days.</p>

  <p class="indent">Some common, non-toxic household substances are as effective as many toxic pesticides. A few drops of dishwashing detergent mixed with water and sprayed on plants is extremely effective in controlling many soft-bodied insects, such as aphids and whiteflies. Crushed garlic mixed with water may control certain insects. A baking soda solution has been shown to help control some fungal diseases on roses.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Alternatives to Pesticides and Chemicals</span></p>

  <p class="indent">When used incorrectly, pesticides can pollute water. They also kill beneficial as well as harmful insects. Natural alternatives prevent both of these events from occurring and save you money. Consider using natural alternatives to chemical pesticides: Non-detergent insecticidal soaps, garlic, hot pepper spray, 1 teaspoon of liquid soap in a gallon of water, used dishwater, or a forceful stream of water from a hose all work to dislodge insects from your garden plants.</p>

  <p class="indent">Another solution is to consider using plants that naturally repel insects. These plants have their own chemical defense systems, and when planted among flowers and vegetables, they help keep unwanted insects away.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Plant Diseases</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Plant disease identification is extremely difficult. In some cases, only laboratory analysis can conclusively identify some diseases. Disease organisms injure plants in several ways: Some attack leaf surfaces and limit the plant’s ability to carry on photosynthesis; others produce substances that clog plant tissues that transport water and nutrients; still other disease organisms produce toxins that kill the plant or replace plant tissue with their own.</p>

  <p class="indent">Symptoms that are associated with plant diseases may include the presence of mushroom-like growths on trunks of trees; leaves with a grayish, mildewed appearance; spots on leaves, flowers, and fruits; sudden wilting or death of a plant or branch; sap exuding from branches or trunks of trees; and stunted growth.</p>

  <p class="indent">Misapplication of pesticides and nutrients, air pollutants, and other environmental conditions—such as flooding and freezing—can also mimic some disease problems. Yellowing or reddening of leaves and stunted growth may indicate a nutritional problem. Leaf curling or misshapen growth may be a result of herbicide application.</p>

  <p class="img"><a id="page_79"/><img alt="image" src="../Images/79-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h3"><a id="page_80"/><span class="bold">Pest and Disease Management Practices</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Preventing pests should be your first goal when growing a garden, although it is unlikely that you will be able to avoid all pest problems because some plant seeds and disease organisms may lay dormant in the soil for years.</p>

  <p class="indent">Diseases need three elements to become established in plants: the disease organism, a susceptible species, and the proper environmental conditions. Some disease organisms can live in the soil for years; other organisms are carried in infected plant material that falls to the ground. Some disease organisms are carried by insects. Good sanitation will help limit some problems with disease. Choosing resistant varieties of plants also prevents many diseases from occurring. Rotating annual plants in a garden can also prevent some diseases.</p>

  <p class="indent">Plants that have adequate, but not excessive, nutrients are better able to resist attacks from both diseases and insects. Excessive rates of nitrogen often result in extremely succulent vegetative growth and can make plants more susceptible to insect and disease problems, as well as decreasing their winter hardiness. Proper watering and spacing of plants limits the spread of some diseases and provides good aeration around plants, so diseases that fester in standing water cannot multiply. Trickle irrigation, where water is applied to the soil and not the plant leaves, may be helpful.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/80-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="bold">Powdery mildew leaf disease.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Removal of diseased material certainly limits the spread of some diseases. It is important to clean up litter dropped from diseased plants. Prune diseased branches on trees and shrubs to allow for more air circulation. When pruning diseased trees and shrubs, disinfect your pruners between cuts with a solution of chlorine bleach to avoid spreading the disease from plant to plant. Also try to control insects that may carry diseases to your plants.</p>

  <p class="indent">You can make your own natural fungicide by combining 5 teaspoons each of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide with a gallon of water. Spray on your infected plants. Milk diluted with water is also an effective fungicide, due to the potassium phosphate in it, which boosts a plant’s immune system. The more diluted the solution, the more frequently you’ll need to spray the plant.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="id19"><a id="page_81"/><span class="bold">Harvesting Your Garden</span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="dcap">I</span>t is essential, in order to get the best freshness, flavor, and nutritional benefits from your garden vegetables and fruits, to harvest them at the appropriate time. The vegetable’s stage of maturity and the time of day at which it is harvested are essential for good-tasting and nutritious produce. Overripe vegetables and fruits will be stringy and coarse. When possible, harvest your vegetables during the cool part of the morning. If you are going to can and preserve your vegetables and fruits, do so as soon as possible. Or, if this process must be delayed, make sure to cool the vegetables in ice water or crushed ice and store them in the refrigerator. Here are some brief guidelines for harvesting various types of common garden produce:</p>

  <p class="indent">Asparagus—Harvest the spears when they are at least 6 to 8 inches tall by snapping or cutting them at ground level. A few spears may be harvested the second year after crowns are set out. A full harvest season will last four to six weeks during the third growing season.</p>

  <p class="indent">Beans, snap—Harvest before the seeds develop in the pod. Beans are ready to pick if they snap easily when bent in half.</p>

  <p class="indent">Beans, lima—Harvest when the pods first start to bulge with the enlarged seeds. Pods must still be green, not yellowish.</p>

  <p class="indent">Broccoli—Harvest the dark green, compact cluster, or head, while the buds are shut tight, before any yellow flowers appear. Smaller side shoots will develop later, providing a continuous harvest.</p>

  <p class="indent">Brussels sprouts—Harvest the lower sprouts (small heads) when they are about 1 to 1½ inches in diameter by twisting them off. Removing the lower leaves along the stem will help to hasten the plant’s maturity.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cabbage—Harvest when the heads feel hard and solid.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cantaloupe—Harvest when the stem slips easily from the fruit with a gentle tug. Another indicator of ripeness is when the netting on the skin becomes rounded and the flesh between the netting turns from a green to a tan color.</p>

  <p class="indent">Carrots—Harvest when the roots are ¾ to 1 inch in diameter. The largest roots generally have darker tops.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cauliflower—When preparing to harvest, exclude sunlight when the curds (heads) are 1 to 2 inches in diameter by loosely tying the outer leaves together above the curd with a string or rubber band. This process is known as blanching. Harvest the curds when they are 4 to 6 inches in diameter but still compact, white, and smooth. The head should be ready ten to fifteen days after tying the leaves.</p>

  <p class="indent">Collards—Harvest older, lower leaves when they reach a length of 8 to 12 inches. New leaves will grow as long as the central growing point remains, providing a continuous harvest. Whole plants may be harvested and cooked if desired.</p>

  <p class="indent">Corn, sweet—The silks begin to turn brown and dry out as the ears mature. Check a few ears for maturity by opening the top of the ear and pressing a few kernels with your thumbnail. If the exuded liquid is milky rather than clear, the ear is ready for harvesting. Cooking a few ears is also a good way to test for maturity.</p>

  <p class="indent">Cucumbers—Harvest when the fruits are 6 to 8 inches in length. Harvest when the color is deep green and before yellow color appears. Pick four to five times per week to encourage continuous production. Leaving mature cucumbers on the vine will stop the production of the entire plant.</p>

  <p class="indent">Eggplant—Harvest when the fruits are 4 to 5 inches in diameter and their color is a glossy, purplish black. The fruit is getting too ripe when the color starts to dull or become bronzed. Because the stem is woody, cut—do not pull—the fruit from the plant. A short stem should remain on each fruit.</p>

  <p class="indent">Kale—Harvest by twisting off the outer, older leaves when they reach a length of 8 to 10 inches and are medium green in color. Heavy, dark green leaves are overripe and are likely to be tough and bitter. New leaves will grow, providing a continuous harvest.</p>

  <p class="indent">Lettuce—Harvest the older, outer leaves from leaf lettuce as soon as they are 4 to 6 inches long. Harvest heading types when the heads are moderately firm and before seed stalks form.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/81-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="img"><a id="page_82"/><img alt="image" src="../Images/82-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="cap"><span class="bold">Only the eggplant vegetable is edible. Do not eat the leaves, stem, roots, or flowers.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Mustard—Harvest the leaves and leaf stems when they are 6 to 8 inches long; new leaves will provide a continuous harvest until they become too strong in flavor and tough in texture due to temperature extremes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Okra—Harvest young, tender pods when they are 2 to 3 inches long. Pick the okra at least every other day during the peak growing season. Overripe pods become woody and are too tough to eat.</p>

  <p class="indent">Onions—Harvest when the tops fall over and begin to turn yellow. Dig up the onions and allow them to dry out in the open sun for a few days to toughen the skin. Then remove the dried soil by brushing the onions lightly. Cut the stem, leaving 2 to 3 inches attached, and store in a net-type bag in a cool, dry place.</p>

  <p class="indent">Peas—Harvest regular peas when the pods are well rounded; edible-pod varieties should be harvested when the seeds are fully developed but still fresh and bright green. Pods are getting too old when they lose their brightness and turn light or yellowish green.</p>

  <p class="indent">Peppers—Harvest sweet peppers with a sharp knife when the fruits are firm, crisp, and full size. Green peppers will turn red if left on the plant. Allow hot peppers to attain their bright red color and full flavor while attached to the vine; then cut them and hang them to dry.</p>

  <p class="indent">Potatoes (Irish)—Harvest the tubers when the plants begin to dry and die down. Store the tubers in a cool, high-humidity location with good ventilation, such as the basement or crawl space of your house. Avoid exposing the tubers to light, as greening, which denotes the presence of dangerous alkaloids, will occur even with small amounts of light.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pumpkins—Harvest pumpkins and winter squash before the first frost. After the vines dry up, the fruit color darkens and the skin surface resists puncture from your thumbnail. Avoid bruising or scratching the fruit while handling it. Leave a 3- to 4-inch portion of the stem attached to the fruit and store it in a cool, dry location with good ventilation.</p>

  <p class="indent">Radishes—Harvest when the roots are ½ to 1½ inches in diameter. The shoulders of radish roots often appear through the soil surface when they are mature. If left in the ground too long, the radishes will become tough and woody.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/82-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="img"><a id="page_83"/><img alt="image" src="../Images/83-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">Rutabagas—Harvest when the roots are about 3 inches in diameter. The roots may be stored in the ground and used as needed, if properly mulched.</p>

  <p class="indent">Spinach—Harvest by cutting all the leaves off at the base of the plant when they are 4 to 6 inches long. New leaves will grow, providing additional harvests.</p>

  <p class="indent">Squash, summer—Harvest when the fruit is soft, tender, and 6 to 8 inches long. The skin color often changes to a dark, glossy green or yellow, depending on the variety. Pick every two to three days to encourage continued production.</p>

  <p class="indent">Sweet potatoes—Harvest the roots when they are large enough for use before the first frost. Avoid bruising or scratching the potatoes during handling. Ideal storage conditions are at a temperature of 55 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 85 percent. The basement or crawl space of a house may suffice.</p>

  <p class="indent">Swiss chard—Harvest by breaking off the developed outer leaves 1 inch above the soil. New leaves will grow, providing a continuous harvest.</p>

  <p class="indent">Tomatoes—Harvest the fruits at the most appealing stage of ripeness, when they are bright red. The flavor is best at room temperature, but ripe fruit may be held in the refrigerator at 45 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit for seven to ten days.</p>

  <p class="indent">Turnips—Harvest the roots when they are 2 to 3 inches in diameter but before heavy fall frosts occur. The tops may be used as salad greens when the leaves are 3 to 5 inches long. Turnips can be eaten almost any way potatoes can be—mashed, roasted, or even fried. The greens can be eaten raw, steamed, or boiled.</p>

  <p class="indent">Watermelons—Harvest when the watermelon produces a dull thud rather than a sharp, metallic sound when thumped—this means the fruit is ripe. Other ripeness indicators are a deep yellow rather than a white color where the melon touches the ground, brown tendrils on the stem near the fruit, and a rough, slightly ridged feel to the skin surface.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="id20"><a id="page_84"/><span class="bold">Community Gardens</span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="dcap">A</span> community garden is considered any piece of land that many people garden. These gardens can be located in urban areas, out in the country, or even in the suburbs, and they grow everything from flowers to vegetables to herbs—anything that the community members want to produce. Community gardens help promote the growing of fresh food, have a positive impact on neighborhoods by cleaning up vacant lots, educate youth about gardening and working together as a community, and bring whole communities together in one common goal. Whether the garden is just one plot or many individual gardens in a specified area, a community garden is a wonderful way to reach out to fellow neighbors while growing fresh foods wherever you live.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">10 Steps to Beginning Your Own Community Garden</span></p>

  <p class="indent">The following steps are adapted from the American Community Garden Association.</p>

  <p class="nlist1">1. Organize a meeting for all those interested. Determine whether a garden is really needed and wanted, what kind it should be (vegetable, flower, or a combination, and organic or not), whom it will involve, and who benefits. Invite neighbors, tenants, community organizations, gardening and horticultural societies, and building superintendents (if it is at an apartment building)—in other words, anyone who is likely to be interested.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/84-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="nlist">2. Establish a planning committee. This group can be made up of people who feel committed to the creation of the garden and who have the time to devote to it, at least in the initial stages. Choose well-organized people as garden coordinators and form committees to tackle specific tasks such as funding and partnerships, youth activities, construction, and communication.</p>

  <p class="nlist">3. Compile all of your resources. Do a community asset assessment. What skills and resources already exist in the community that can aid in the garden’s creation? Contact local municipal planners about possible sites, as well as horticultural societies and other local sources of information and assistance. Look within your community for people with experience in landscaping and gardening.</p>

  <p class="nlist">4. Look for a sponsor. Some gardens “self-support” through membership dues, but for many, a sponsor is essential for donations of tools, seeds, or money. Churches, schools, private businesses, or parks and recreation departments are all possible sponsors.</p>

  <p class="nlist">5. Choose a site for your garden. Consider the amount of daily sunshine (vegetables need at least six hours a day), availability of water, and soil testing for possible pollutants. Find out who owns the land. Can the gardeners get a lease agreement for at least three years? Will public liability insurance be necessary?</p>

  <p class="nlist">6. Prepare and develop the chosen site. In most cases, the land will need considerable preparation for planting. Organize volunteer work crews to clean it, gather materials, and decide on the design and plot arrangement.</p>

  <div class="box1">
    <p class="box1hd"><span class="bold">START A SCHOOL GARDEN</span></p>

    <p class="indent">The local school might be the perfect place to start a community garden—explain the project to the principal and ask his or her permission to use a portion of the school grounds. You may even want to work with the school food service personnel to use products from the garden in a special school lunch, school-wide salad, or food festival.</p>

    <p class="indent">Use the following checklist to get your garden up and running:</p>

    <p class="h5"><span class="bold">What to Do</span></p>

    <p class="indent">Pick a Spot:</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Make sure the vegetable garden gets at least six hours of sunshine a day—otherwise the seeds produce plants and leaves and not much food. If the plot chosen doesn’t have enough sunshine, try growing vegetables that have leaves such as lettuce. Or try vegetables such as carrots, parsley, chives, or zucchini, which need only four to five hours of daily sun. Keep drainage in mind—a garden needs to drain well, so try to avoid the low spot where puddles form.</p>

    <p class="indent1">How Big Does the Garden Grow?</p>

    <p class="blist">•   A big harvest can be gotten from a garden that is only 4 feet by 4 feet. You probably don’t want a garden bigger than 10 feet by 10 feet unless you don’t mind the work!</p>

    <p class="indent1">Plan Your Garden:</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Point north. Find the north side of the plot, because that’s where the tall plants should go, so they don’t shade shorter ones. Stand facing the sunset; north is the direction to the right. Plants are grown in rows, so the garden will be a square or rectangle.</p>

    <p class="indent1">Things You’ll Need:</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Planting, growing, and harvesting tools</p>

    <p class="blist"><a id="page_85"/>•   Seeds, seedlings, and organic material, such as compost, manure, or peat moss</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Long-handled shovels, hoes, rakes, garden spades, and three pronged hand cultivators</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Scissors, knives, and containers (baskets, bowls, or cardboard boxes)</p>

    <p class="indent1">Decide What to Plant:</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Think about what vegetables to grow and decide on the number of plants needed. Involve the children in this part of the planning process.</p>

    <p class="indent1">Design the Site:</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Draw a picture of the garden and plan out what plants will grow in which rows. Figure how far apart the rows should be. Find out how wide the plants will get, add the two widths together, and divide by 2. That’s how far apart the rows should be. This will make it easier on planting day.</p>

    <p class="h5"><span class="bold">Once the Garden is Designed—Then What?</span></p>

    <p class="indent">Test the Soil:</p>

    <p class="blist">•   If the soil has not been tested, conduct a soil test. Call a local Cooperative Extension Service office, listed under county or state government, for the name and location of a laboratory to do testing for lead content and soil pH or see <a href="../Text/005_Part001.html#page_14">page 14</a> to do your own soil testing. A soil test tells two things: (a) lead level of the soil; and (b) whether the soil is <span class="italic">acid</span> (sour), <span class="italic">alkaline</span> (sweet), or <span class="italic">neutral</span> (neither sour nor sweet). Lead is a poison and if it gets into the plants, it will get into the food. Plants will not grow well in soil that is either too acid or too alkaline.</p>

    <p class="indent">Get the Tools:</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Long-handled shovels, gardening spades, spading forks, hoes, and rakes are all excellent tools for beginning a garden. To care for the garden, use hand tools such as three-pronged hand cultivators, hose and nozzle, and/or watering cans. If the group doesn’t have its own garden tools, find someone who has what is needed and ask to borrow the tools. Or check yard sales to buy used tools.</p>

    <p class="indent">Prepare the Soil:</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Once the soil is dry enough, dig it and loosen it. Involve children and youth in the process of preparing the soil.</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Remove grass and weeds (roots and all). Take the time to do this well.</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Dig the soil as deep as the blade of the spade and turn the soil. Or, find someone to till the soil with a rototiller.</p>

    <p class="blist">•   If the soil test showed the soil to be too acid, add limestone (lime); if the soil is too alkaline, add ground agricultural sulfur. Sprinkle either lime or sulfur evenly over the garden soil.</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Add organic material such as compost, manure, or peat moss. This helps feed the plants and enriches the soil. Spread evenly on top of the turned soil in a layer no deeper than 3 inches.</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Blend everything using a spading fork, until the soil is so soft that planting can be done with the hands.</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Rake the soil until the soil is smooth and level, with no hills or holes. This will allow the water to seep down to the roots.</p>

    <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/85-1.jpg"/></p>
  </div>

  <div class="box1">
    <a id="page_86"/>

    <p class="box1hd"><span class="bold">GET READY TO PLANT</span></p>

    <p class="indent">Children will enjoy accompanying adults on a trip to purchase seeds or seedlings (also called transplants) for the vegetables you intend to plant. Some plants do better if you start with seedlings rather than seeds. Seedlings are the fastest way to grow plants, and the easiest.</p>

    <p class="blist">•   To identify what you have planted, buy or make stakes, and write the names of the plants on the stakes with a waterproof marker. Save the stakes for later use.</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Here is another place that children and youth can help. If seeds are planted: make a shallow straight line (furrow) in the soil with a finger.</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Put the seeds in the furrow about half an inch apart or as suggested on the seed packaging.</p>

    <p class="blist">•   When the seeds are in the furrow, squeeze the furrow closed with thumb and finger.</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Water the soil right after the seeds are planted—water the plants so that the water comes out like a shower.</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Place the marker stakes in the soil at one end of the row to identify what has been planted.</p>

    <p class="blist">•   If another kind of plant is planted, check the distance between the rows following your design.</p>

    <p class="blist">•   If seedlings are planted in each row, mark the spot where the plants should go, by poking a hole in the soil using a finger or the end of a pole. Do the entire row at one time.</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Set each plant in the soil so that it isn’t too high or too low but just above the root ball. Cover the root ball with soil and press the soil gently so there are no empty spaces near the roots.</p>

    <p class="blist">•   Feed the seedlings with a mixture of fertilizer and water. Water each plant once, let the water soak in, and water a second time. Depending on what plants are grown, this feeding may need to be done every two to three weeks.</p>

    <p class="h6">Tending the Garden:</p>

    <p class="indent">Visit the garden daily—check if the garden needs watering, weeding, feeding, and thinning. Make sure to bring the proper tools. Take the children and youth to the garden and have them help care for the plants. Two hours is plenty of time for them to work in the garden at any one time. Children and youth can do weeding, thinning, and harvesting of crops.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="nlist">7. Organize the layout of the garden. Members must decide how many plots are available and how they will be assigned. Allow space for storing tools and making compost, and allot room for pathways between each plot. Plant flowers or shrubs around the garden’s edges to promote goodwill with non-gardening neighbors, pedestrians, and municipal authorities.</p>

  <p class="nlist">8. Plan a garden just for kids. Consider creating a special garden for the children of the community—including them is essential. Children are not as interested in the size of the harvest but rather in the process of gardening. A separate area set aside for them allows them to explore the garden at their own speed and can be a valuable learning tool.</p>

  <p class="nlist">9. Draft rules and put them in writing. The gardeners themselves devise the best ground rules. We are more willing to comply with rules that we have had a hand in creating. Ground rules help gardeners to know what is expected of them. Think of it as a code of behavior. Some examples of issues that are best dealt with by agreed-upon rules are: What kinds of dues will members pay? How will the money be used? How are plots assigned? Will gardeners share tools, meet regularly, and handle basic maintenance?</p>

  <p class="nlist">10. Keep members involved with one another. Good communication ensures a strong community garden with active participation by all. Some ways to do this are: form a telephone tree, create an e-mail list, install a rainproof bulletin board in the garden, and have regular community celebrations. Community gardens are all about creating and strengthening communities.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/86-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Tools Needed to Create and Maintain a Community Garden</span></p>

  <p class="indent">When purchasing tools for your community garden, buy high-quality tools. These will last longer and are an investment that will benefit your garden and those working in it for years to come. Every community garden should be equipped with these ten essential tools:</p>

  <p class="indent">Fork: You can’t dig and divide perennials without a heavy-duty fork.</p>

  <p class="indent">Gloves: Leather gloves hold up best. If you have roses, get a pair that is thick enough to resist thorn pricks.</p>

  <p class="indent">Hand fork or cultivator: A hand fork helps cultivate soil, chop up clumps, and work fertilizer and compost into the soil. A hand fork is necessary for cultivating in closely planted beds.</p>

  <p class="indent">Hand pruners: There are different types and sizes of pruners depending on the type and size of the job. Hand pruners are for cutting small diameters, up to the thickness of your little finger.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_87"/>Hoe: A long-handled hoe is key to keeping weeds out of your garden.</p>

  <p class="indent">Hose: This is the fastest way to transport lots of water to your garden plants. Consider using drip irrigation hoses or tape to apply a steady stream of water to your plants.</p>

  <p class="indent">Shovels and spades: There are several different types and shapes of shovels and spades, each with its own purpose. There are also different types of handles for either—a D shape, a T shape, or none at all. A shovel is a requisite tool for planting large perennials, shrubs, and trees; breaking ground; and moving soil, leaves, and just about anything else. The sharper the blade, the better.</p>

  <p class="indent">Trowel: A well-made trowel is your most important tool. From container gardening to large beds, a trowel will help you get your plants into the soil.</p>

  <p class="indent">Watering can: A watering can creates a fine, even stream of water that delivers with a gentleness that won’t wash seedlings or sprouting seeds out of their soil.</p>

  <p class="indent">Wheelbarrow: Wheelbarrows come in all different sizes (and prices). They are indispensable for hauling soil, compost, plants, mulch, hoses, tools, and everything else you’ll need to make your garden a success.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Things to Consider</span></p>

  <p class="indent">There are many things that need to be considered when you create your own community garden. Remember that community gardens take a lot of work and foresight in order for them to be successful and beneficial for all those involved.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">The Organization of the Garden</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Will your garden establish rules and conditions for membership—such as residence, dues, and agreement with any drafted rules and regulations? It is important to know who will be able to use the garden and who will not. Furthermore, deciding how the garden will be parceled out is another key topic to discuss before beginning your community garden. Will the plots be assigned by family size or need? Will some plots be bigger to accommodate larger families? Will your garden incorporate children’s plots as well?</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Insurance</span></p>

  <p class="indent">It is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain leases from landowners without liability insurance. Garden insurance is a new thing for many insurance carriers, and their underwriters are reluctant to cover community gardens. It helps if you know what you want out of your community garden before you start talking to insurance agents. Two tips: Work with an agent from a firm that deals with many different carriers (so you can get the best policy for your needs); and you will probably have better success with someone local who has already done this type of policy or who works with social service agencies in the area. Shop around until you find a policy that fits the needs of your community garden and its users.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/87-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Set Up a Garden Association</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Many garden groups are organized very informally and operate successfully. Leaders “rise to the occasion” to propose ideas and carry out tasks. However, as the workload expands, many groups choose a more formal structure for their organization.</p>

  <p class="indent">A structured program is a conscious, planned effort to create a system so that each person can participate fully and the group can perform effectively. It’s vital that the leadership be responsive to the members and their needs.</p>

  <p class="indent">If your group is new, have several planning meetings to discuss your program and organization. Try out suggestions raised at these meetings, and after a few months of operation, you’ll be in a better position to develop bylaws or organizational guidelines. A community garden project should be kept as simple as possible.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Creating Bylaws</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Bylaws are rules that govern the internal affairs of an organization. Check out bylaws from other community garden organization when creating your own. The bylaws of your community garden can be as simple as rules and regulations. This is usually plenty adequate for small community garden affairs.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bylaws cover these topics:</p>

  <p class="blist1">•   The full name of the organization and address</p>

  <p class="blist">•   The organizing members and their addresses</p>

  <p class="blist"><a id="page_88"/>•   The purpose, goal, and philosophy of the organization</p>

  <p class="blist">•   Membership eligibility and dues</p>

  <p class="blist">•   Timeline for regular meetings of the committee</p>

  <p class="blist">•   How the bylaws can be rescinded or amended</p>

  <p class="blist">•   Maintenance and cleanup of the community garden</p>

  <p class="blist">•   A hold harmless clause: “We the undersigned members of the [name] garden group hereby agree to hold harmless [name landowner] from and against any damage, loss, liability, claim, demand, suit, cost, and expense directly or indirectly resulting from, arising out of or in connection with the use of the [name] garden by the garden group, its successors, assigns, employees, agents, and invitees.”</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Sample Guidelines and Rules for Garden Members</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Here are some sample guidelines community garden members may need to follow:</p>

  <p class="blist">•   I will pay a fee of $___ to help cover garden expenses.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   I will have something planted in the garden by [date] and keep it planted all summer long.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   If I must abandon my plot for any reason, I will notify the garden leadership.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   I will keep weeds at a minimum and maintain the areas immediately surrounding my plot.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   If my plot becomes unkempt, I understand I will be given one week’s notice to clean it up. At that time, it will be reassigned or tilled in.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   I will keep trash and litter out of the plot, as well as adjacent pathways and fences.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   I will participate in the fall cleanup of the garden.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   I will plant tall crops where they will not shade neighboring plots.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   I will pick only my own crops unless given permission by another plot user.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   I will not use fertilizers, insecticides, or weed repellents that will in any way affect other plots.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   I understand that neither the garden group nor owners of the land are responsible for my actions. I therefore agree to hold harmless the garden group and owners of the land for any liability, damage, loss, or claim that occurs in connection with use of the garden by me or any of my guests.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">Preventing Vandalism of Your Community Garden</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Vandalism is a common fear among community gardeners. Try to deter vandalism by following these simple, preventative methods:</p>

  <p class="blist1">•   Make a sign for the garden. Let people know that the garden is a community project.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   Put up fences around your garden. Fences can be of almost any material. They serve as much to mark possession of a property as to prevent entry.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   Invite everyone in the neighborhood to participate in the garden project from the very beginning. If you exclude people, they may become potential vandals.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   Plant raspberries, roses, or other thorny plants along the fence as a barrier to anyone trying to climb the fence.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   Make friends with neighbors whose windows overlook the garden. Trade them flowers and vegetables for a protective eye.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   Harvest all ripe fruit and vegetables on a daily basis to prevent the temptation of outsiders to harvest your crops.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   Plant a “vandal’s garden” at the entrance. Mark it with a sign: “If you must take food, please take it from here.”</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">People Problems and Solutions</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Angry neighbors and bad gardeners pose problems for a community garden. Neighbors may complain to municipal governments about messy, unkempt gardens or rowdy behavior; most gardens cannot afford poor relations with neighbors, local politicians, or potential sponsors. Therefore, choose bylaws carefully so you have procedures to follow when members fail to keep their plots clean and up to code. A well-organized garden with strong leadership and committed members can overcome almost any obstacle.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">School Gardens</span></p>

  <p class="indent">A school garden provides children with an ideal outdoor classroom. Within a single visit to a garden, a student can record plant growth, study decomposition while turning a compost pile, and learn more about plants, nature, and the outdoors in general. Gardens also provide students with opportunities to make healthier food choices, learn about nutrient cycles, and develop a deeper appreciation for the environment, community, and each other. While school gardens are typically used for science classes, they can also teach children about the history of their community (what there town was like hundreds of years ago and what people did to farm food), and be incorporated into math curriculum and other school subjects.</p>

  <p class="h4"><span class="bold">How to Start a School Garden</span></p>

  <p class="indent">School gardens do not need to start on a grand scale. In fact, individual classrooms can grow their very own container gardens just by planting seeds in small pots, watering them daily, placing them in a sunny corner of the room, and watching the seedlings grow. However, if there is space for a larger, outdoor garden, this is the ideal place to teach children about working as a community, about plants and vegetables, and responsibility. A school garden should eventually become a permanent addition to the school and be maintained year-round.</p>

  <p class="indent">When starting a school garden, it is important to find someone to coordinate the garden program. This is the perfect way to get parents involved in the school’s garden. Establish a volunteer garden committee and assign certain parents particular tasks in the planning, upkeep (even during the summer months when school is generally not in session), and funding for the school’s garden.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_89"/>It is important, so the garden is not neglected, to plan particular classroom activities and lessons that will incorporate the garden and its plants. Assigning students various jobs that relate to the garden will be a wonderful way of introducing them to gardening as well as responsibility and community.</p>

  <p class="indent">After all the initial planning is done, it is time to choose a spot for the school garden. A place in the lawn that receives plenty of sunlight and that will be close enough to the building for easy access is ideal. It should also be near an outdoor spigot so the plants can be easily watered. If there is enough space, it might be beneficial to have a garden shed, where gardening gloves, tools, buckets, hoses, and other items can be stored for use in the garden. Once you have chosen your spot, it’s time to start digging and planting!</p>

  <p class="indent">Both new and established gardens benefit from the use of compost and mulch. Many schools purchase compost when they initially establish their garden, and then they start making their own compost—which is a wonderful scientific lesson for students as well. You can use grass clippings, yard trimmings, rotten vegetables, and even food scraps from the cafeteria or students’ lunches to build and maintain your compost pile. While some schools choose to make compost piles in the garden, others compost with worm boxes right in the classroom!</p>

  <p class="indent">Depending on funding and the needs and desires of the school, these gardens can become quite elaborate, with fences, ponds, trellises, trees and shrubs, and other structures. However, all a school garden truly needs is a little bit of dirt and a few plants (preferably an assortment of vegetables, fruit, and wildflowers) that students can study and even eat. Whether the school garden is established only for one class or grade level, or if it is going to be available to everyone at the school, is a factor that will determine the types of plants and the size of the overall garden.</p>

  <p class="indent">Whether big or small, complex or simple, school gardens provide a wonderful, enriching learning experience for children and their parents alike.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="id21"><a id="page_90"/><span class="bold">Farmers’ Markets</span></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="dcap">F</span>armers’ markets are an integral part of the urban–farm linkage and have continued to rise in popularity, mostly due to growing consumer interest in obtaining fresh products directly from the farm. Farmers’ markets allow consumers to have access to locally grown, farm-fresh produce, enable farmers the opportunity to develop a personal relationship with their customers, and cultivate consumer loyalty with the farmers who grow the produce. Direct marketing of farm products through farmers’ markets continues to be an important sales outlet for agricultural producers nationwide. Today, there are more than 4,600 farmers’ markets operating throughout the nation.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Who Benefits from Farmers’ Markets?</span></p>

  <p class="blist">•   Small farm operators: Those with less than $250,000 in annual receipts who work and manage their own operations meet this definition (94 percent of all farms).</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/90-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/90-2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="blist">•   Farmers and consumers: Farmers have direct access to markets to supplement farm income. Consumers have access to locally grown, farm-fresh produce and the opportunity to personally interact with the farmer who grows the produce.</p>

  <p class="blist">•   The community: Many urban communities—where fresh, nutritious foods are scarce—gain easy access to quality food. Farmers’ markets also help to promote nutrition education, wholesome eating habits, and better food preparation, as well as boosting the community’s economy.</p>

  <p class="h3"><span class="bold">Getting Involved in a Farmers’ Market</span></p>

  <p class="indent">A farmers’ market is a great place for new gardeners to learn what sorts of produce customers want, and it also promotes wonderful community relationships between the growers and the buyers. If you have a well-established garden, and know a few other people who also have fruits, vegetables, and even garden flowers to spare, you may want to consider organizing and implementing your own local farmers’ market (if your town or city already has an established farmers’ market, you may want to go visit it one day and ask the farmers how you could join, or contact your local Cooperative Extension Service for more information). Joining existing farmers’ markets may require that you pay an annual fee, and your produce may also be subject to inspection and other rules established by the market’s organization or the local government.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_91"/>Establishing a farmers’ market is not simply setting up a stand in front of your home and selling your vegetables—though you can certainly do this if you prefer. A farmers’ market must have a small group of people who are all looking to sell their produce and garden harvests. It is important, before planning even begins, to hold a meeting and discuss the feasibility of your venture. Is there other local competition that might impede on your market’s success? Are there enough people and enough produce to make a farmers’ market profitable and sustainable? What kind of monetary cost will be incurred by establishing a farmers’ market? It is also a good idea to think about how you can sponsor your market—such as though members, nonprofit organizations, or the chamber of commerce. If at all possible, it is best to try to get your entire neighborhood and local government involved and promote the idea of fresh, home-grown fruits and vegetables that will be available to the community through the establishment of a farmers’ market.</p>

  <p class="indent">Once you’ve decided that you want to go ahead with your plan, you should establish rules for your market. Such rules and regulations should determine if there will be a board of directors, who will be responsible for the overall management of the market, who can become a member, where the market will be located (preferably in a place with ample parking, good visibility, and cover in case of bad weather), and when and for how long the market will be open to the public. It is also a good idea to discuss how the produce should be priced and make sure you are following all local and state regulations.</p>

  <p class="indent">Ideally, it is beneficial for your market’s vendors and the community to gather support and involvement from local farmers in your area. That way, your garden vegetable and fruit stand will be supplemented with other locally grown produce and crops from farms, which will draw more people to your market.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="image" src="../Images/91-1.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="indent">Once your farmers’ market is up and running, it is important to maintain a good rapport with the community. Be friendly when customers come to your stand, and make sure that you are offering quality products for them to purchase. Price your vegetables and fruits fairly and make your displays pleasing to the eye, luring customers to your stall. Make sure your produce is clearly marked with the name and price, so your customers will have no doubt as to what they are buying. Make your stall as personal as possible, and always, always interact with the customer. In this way, you’ll begin to build relationships with your community members and hopefully continue to draw in business for yourself and the other vendors in the farmers’ market.</p>

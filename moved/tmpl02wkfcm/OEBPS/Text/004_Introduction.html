  <p class="noindent">More and more families are being drawn toward a lifestyle that is greener, cleaner, more genuine, and more aware. We want to know where our food is coming from, to the point of touching the dirt that it springs out of, if possible. We want our children (or nieces or nephews or godchildren) to understand that eggs come from chickens—not just from cardboard cartons on supermarket shelves. We love the idea of building things with our own hands, of picking our own berries, of making fresh bread and spreading it with homemade butter. We are, in short, longing for self-sufficiency.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Self-sufficiency” as a term is somewhat misleading. “The good life” that most of us are seeking in our varied ways does not involve cutting off ties from those who surround us. Complete independence is not possible and, at least for most people, would not bring much satisfaction anyway. The early settlers banded together whenever they could, knowing their lives would be made easier and better by the community’s support. In similar ways, we benefit from those who have ventured into back-to-basics living before us, and we would be wise to share ideas, tools, and experiences with those on similar paths around us now. But we do not need to be trapped by dependency on anyone or any group—or any idea, for that matter. We can be responsible for growing or raising at least a portion of what we consume; we can find ways to fix things rather than running to the store to buy replacements; we can teach our children ourselves, rather than leaving the burden entirely on public or private schools.</p>

  <p class="indent">People and experience are the best teachers when it comes to learning things like how to plant a garden or milk a cow. But sometimes you don’t have a neighbor to call on for advice and trial and error will result in more error than the trial is worth. That’s where this book comes in. You’ll find instructions and tips for everything from growing tomatoes to canning jams and jellies to constructing a chicken coop. Scattered throughout are fun projects for “The Junior Homesteader” and “Homeschooling Hints,” which can be used to supplement your children’s education, whether or not you choose to participate in a traditional schooling system. You’ll also find plenty of photographs and illustrations to add clarity and interest to the written directions. Let these pages inspire and direct you as you discover what self-sufficiency means for you.</p>

<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">You’ll need a puncture repair kit and a bicycle pump.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Turn the bike upside down so it’s only resting on the seat and the handlebars; remove any obvious cause of the puncture, like a nail, from the tire.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Take the wheel off your bike, disconnecting the brake first if applicable, and let out any air remaining in the inner tube by pushing up on the tire valve.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Use tire levers to ease the tire and punctured inner tube off the wheel: insert one lever between the tire and the rim and push down to lift the tire up. Run around the rim with a second lever to free the tire completely. Carefully lift the tube out of the tire.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_95"/><span class="cl_4A4B62">Run your fingers slowly along the inside of the tire, feeling for any remaining debris that might still be lodged in the rubber.Pump air into the tube until you can locate the leak, either by feeling or hearing the hiss of escaping air. Mark the hole with a pen and push the air out of the tube.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Sand around the area for repair with the sandpaper that comes in your repair kit. Spread a thin layer of glue over and around the hole and allow it to dry until the glue is no longer shiny.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Take a repair patch, peel off the backing and press it firmly into place over the glue.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Guide the tube back into the tire, aligning the valve with its hole in the rim. Push the tire back onto the rim with your hands, rather than tools, to prevent another puncture.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Reconnect the brake if necessary when you put the wheel back on your bike. If the rear wheel was removed, edge the chain round the gear cluster. The tire rim should be centerd between the brakes. Finally, re-inflate the tire.</span></p>

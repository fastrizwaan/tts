<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Find yourself someone with a vehicle and a set of jump leads to help you out.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-num"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>1</strong></span> Park the assisting vehicle so the jump leads will reach between the two vehicles. The two vehicles <strong>must not</strong> touch.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-num"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>2</strong></span> Switch off your ignition and all electrical devices of both cars. Connect one end of the red positive lead to the positive terminal of your battery. Connect the other end of this lead to the positive terminal of the donor battery.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-num"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>3</strong></span> Connect the black negative lead to the donor battery first, then attach the other end to an unpainted metal surface of your car, away from the battery (e.g. a metal strut for the bonnet). Check all four grips are secure.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-num"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>4</strong></span> Start the engine of the donor vehicle and run it at idling speed. Let it run for a couple of minutes then start your car’s engine.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-num"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>5</strong></span> Remove the negative jump lead, then the positive one, disconnecting from the battery on your own vehicle first. Make sure they don’t touch each other or any other metal surface.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-num"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><span class="num"><strong>6</strong></span> Drive, or leave your engine running for 30 minutes. Have your battery checked out at your garage workshop.</span></p>&#13;

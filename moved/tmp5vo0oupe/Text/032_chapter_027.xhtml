<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Keep a sewing kit handy for simple repairs. It should contain: needles, needle threader, white, black and a range of colored cotton thread, sewing scissors, pins and a tape measure.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Choose the color thread to match or contrast with the material you plan to sew by holding a single thread against the fabric. Cotton thread has a sheen to it, so you may need to go a shade darker. Use cotton thread on cottons, linens and other natural fabrics; match synthetic thread to man-made fabrics to prevent threads from breaking.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Select the right size needle for the thickness of fabric. Flatten the needle threader’s diamond-shaped wire and feed it through the eye of the needle. Insert a length of thread into the diamond shape. Pull the wire back through the needle’s eye and you’re almost ready to sew. To avoid frustrating tangles, resist using too long a thread and keep the shorter end around 2 inches. Remember to adjust the thread as you go so that the short end isn’t sewn into the fabric.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Next, you need a knot. Lick your forefinger. Take the end of the thread and wrap it round the tip of that finger so that it overlaps across your finger pad. With your thumb against your finger, roll the thread off and pull the roll down to form a strong knot at the base of the thread.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Once you’re finished sewing, fasten off on the underside of the fabric by sewing four small stitches over the top of each other. Pass the needle through the loop of the last stitch before pulling tight and repeat this action. Cut the thread with scissors, leaving a tiny tail.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><strong>Backstitch</strong> creates a strong bond and is best for repairing seams.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_37"/><span class="cl_4A4B62">Use <strong>slip stitch</strong> for hemming as it is almost invisible on both sides.</span></p>&#13;

<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62"><strong>Overcast stitch</strong> contains fraying seams.</span></p>&#13;

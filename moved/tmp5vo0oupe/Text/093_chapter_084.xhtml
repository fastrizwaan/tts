<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">It’s handy to have a measure of the distance you’ve traveled in case you’re off target. Understanding how far you walk in a day, or a given number of hours, can prevent you from missing meal stops or overambitious expeditions that sap pleasure and morale.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Measure your pace before you set off. Calculate the distance it takes you to do a double stride and pace this out over 100 yards. Double stride counting as you walk is less counting to do on the journey! Repeat until you feel you have a good average to work with, remembering that slopes and uneven ground can shorten your normal pace.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">On the other hand, you can time how long it takes you to walk between two spots. Again walking conditions can affect your speed, and inclines and descents will have an impact on timing out in the field.</span></p>&#13;

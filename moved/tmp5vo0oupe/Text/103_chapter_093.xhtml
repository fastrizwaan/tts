<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">This procedure is designed to keep an unconscious person safe until medical help arrives, provided the person is breathing and has no other life-threatening injury.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">If they are lying on their back, kneel next to them. Take the arm nearest to you and place it at a right-angle to their body so their palm faces upwards (image 1). Lift their other arm, bend it at the elbow and position it under their cheek so their cheek is resting on the back of their hand. Hold it in place (image 2).</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">With your free hand, lift their knee that is furthest away from you and bend it until their foot can rest flat on the floor (image 3). From this position, you can roll them onto their side to face you (image 4). Start the roll by pulling carefully on their bent knee.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Once this is done, check that they can breathe properly and any blood or vomit from their mouth can clear. Tilt their head back and their chin forward to assist.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">If you suspect a spinal injury, instead of tilting their head support it with both hands—one on either side—and use your fingertips to gently open their jaw, without moving their neck. Should you need to put them in the recovery position because you can’t keep the airway to their lungs open, do your utmost to keep their spine as straight as possible. Other people can assist with this. Two people on each side of the person can help you keep them in a straight line from head to feet as you roll their body over.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Once the person is in the recovery position, dial 911 for an ambulance and check their breathing.</span></p>&#13;

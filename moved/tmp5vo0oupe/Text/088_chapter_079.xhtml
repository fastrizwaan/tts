<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Open fires are not allowed in some camping areas, which means cooking must happen over a portable camping stove. But you don’t have to buy a camping stove if you know how to make your own out of a couple of empty tin cans. There’s no need to buy a gas canister either as you’ll be burning materials to produce gas naturally. You will, however, need to have a few DIY tools.</span></p>&#13;

<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Find two food cans, one smaller than the other.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Remove the lids of both cans with a can opener. Tip out the contents and save for later. Clean and dry the cans. Remove the labels.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Invert the big can on a table top and center the smaller can on top of it. With a permanent marker, draw a ring around the diameter of the small can. Punch a hole in the bottom of the larger can with a pair of sheet metal shears. Snip away the base from the punched hole to the marked circle. Smooth the edges with a file.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Towards the other end of the large can, drill a series of holes with a small drill bit around its bottom perimeter. Drill a second lot of holes above and in between the first row. Then enlarge all the holes <a id="page_99"/>with a bigger drill bit.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Using the small drill bit again, pepper the whole bottom of the small can with evenly spaced holes. Now drill a ring of small holes on the outside of the can, round the perimeter closest to the bottom. Repeat the same procedure as with the large can—drilling a second, alternate row and then enlarging them. Then drill a ring of smaller holes round the top edge of the small can.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Fit the small can completely inside the big can, bottom to bottom, and you’re good to go! Fill it up with twigs, pine cones and other natural materials. Light with a match and start cooking straight away.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Use outside only and directly on soil, concrete or a heatproof surface as your stove will become extremely hot.</span></p>&#13;

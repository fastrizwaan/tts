<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">This is a great skill to whip out when someone relocates the only bottle opener at a party.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Find something that can flip open the top, such as a spoon. The indented metal lock within a door frame will also work—try not to use the inside of a wooden door frame as it risks leaving an indentation. Most can openers have a bottle opener, so check this too.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">If you’re nowhere near the kitchen, try levering the top off with another beer bottle inverted against the teeth of the cap. A key, a thin coin, a flat-headed screwdriver, the edge of the arm of BBQ tongs, or a burger flipper will also do the trick—as will the square end of a lipstick case. Even a single sheet of paper will work if folded lengthways to a tiny flat strip, folded in half and the fold used as a lever.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Don’t be tempted to use your teeth or a kitchen knife to do the job as this could result in an unwanted trip to the dentist or your local emergency room.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">If you’re a car owner, think about keeping a spare opener in the car for outdoor events and picnics. Or to save you the trouble next time, get a Swiss Army knife or a key ring with a bottle opener attached.</span></p>&#13;

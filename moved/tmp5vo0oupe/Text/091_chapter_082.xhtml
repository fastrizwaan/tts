<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Leave no trace when you have to go in the big outdoors.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Choose a private spot well away from water, your campsite or footpaths. Dig a hole 6 to 8 inches deep. Do the deed and use toilet paper—it’s biodegradable. Re-cover the hole with any leaves or ground cover that was there beforehand. Don’t worry if you see worms or insects in the top soil—leave them there, as they will break down your waste. Cleanse your hands with sanitizer gel.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">When the ground is frozen or you’re on rocky terrain you’ll need to pack a poo kit consisting of newspaper, a plastic bag and a leak-proof container. First, lay the newspaper on the ground and go to the toilet on this. When you’ve finished, bag it up and place it in the leak-proof container. Don’t forget to dispose of it when you return to civilization.</span></p>&#13;

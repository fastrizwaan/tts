<p class="noindenta"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Turn off the water supply at the stopcock immediately, as well as the central heating boiler and the immersion heater. Then open every hot and cold tap to drain out any remaining water. If neighbors below or adjoining your property might be affected, let them know about the leak as this might give them time to lessen the chance of damage to their homes. Switch off your electricity at the mains if there is a possibility that leaking water might affect electrical wiring or fittings.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">When the leak is caused by a loose joint, this can be tightened with a wrench.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">If the leak is in the pipe, there are a number of different pipe repair kits that can be purchased. These include, for example, specialist tape, self-tapping plugs that fit into the hole in the pipe and expand, or screw-on clamps. If in doubt about which to buy, take a picture of your pipe hole with your phone and show it to staff at your DIY shop. Follow the instructions supplied with your chosen kit.</span></p>&#13;

<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">You can also buy a new length of pipe. However, bear in mind that copper pipes must be soldered into place. If you’re not confident with this type of repair, call a professional plumber.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span class="cl_4A4B62">Remember to refill your water system before relighting your boiler or turning on the immersion heater if you’re fixing the pipe yourself.</span></p>&#13;
